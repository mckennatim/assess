A collection of scripts written to support computer use in the classroom for my Humanities classes from 2005-2011 at Parkway Academy of Technology and Health (PATH), a BostonPublic Schools High School. Each student at PATH had a laptop. 
<br/>
The main computer platform for my courses was Mediawiki. Each student had an account on the wiki and used their account pages as scratchpad, a workbook, as a place for in-class writing, for quizzes and exams and for all the stages of essays and research papers. 

<br/>
Some scripts allow me to interact with medaiwiki through its API, doing things like injecting pages into students' acount pages. Check the [https://github.com/mckennatim/assess/tree/master/WikiBot WikiBot directory]. Other scripts helped me to create general course content that would show up on the course wiki's. 
<br/>
There were course wikis for most of the courses I taught, with an new version every year. Other supporting technology included forums and blogs. Course Wiki's have been archived and some are still hosted in read-only format. Some links to course wikis:
;http://www.pathboston.com/hum4: - a senior level Humanities course focusing on the literature and history of the world from 1500-present
