''Ideas? Functional Reform? Process Reform? Reform vs Renewal vs Proposals?''<br>
We must clarify the intent of these working pages in order to clarify their titles. I envision also that SPP will be broken up into two or more specified groups (either totally split or denominated within the group) to better focus the discussion. 'Visions' and 'Strategies' are a good place to start. Please discuss!]
