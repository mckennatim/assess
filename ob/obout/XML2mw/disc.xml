==Consensus Process==
:[[user:pcovery]] Oct 11, 2011 11:04 am
The simplified process described here is not what I've heard at the actual GA. The page here lists only two discussion steps:
    1. Asks if there are any strong objections
    2. Asks if there are any friendly amendments 

The actual GA uses, as well as I can remember:
1. Clarifying questions;
2. Points of information;
3. Strong concerns or objections;
4. Friendly amendments;
5. Blocks.

I don't fully understand the value of separating these segments, especially when many participants are inexperienced in distinguishing them.  When the steps are repeated for amended proposals it's hard to keep track of where we are, much less what progress we've made.  

Suggestions that occur to me:
1. Combine segments on Clarifying Questions and Points of Information. 
2. Post a large poster listing discussion segments and point to the current step.  Projecting the text of what's currently being considered (as most recently amended) would also be awesome, but that's hard to do.
3. Spend less time explaining each step and hand signal at the beginning. Rely on floor managers to help people get attention at the right time with the right signal.  Floor monitors have needed to help each person anyway, so let's not waste time describing process details before each GA.
4. Post a large sign identifying hand signals.
5. Expand the description of consensus process steps and then print it for people to see on site.

BTW, LOVE the process, and just want to see it get even better!

::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 12, 2011 5:21 pm
pcovery, please consider adding your proposal here: &lt;http://occupyboston.wikispaces.com/Suggestion+Box&gt;. 

tips: 1. create a new page with a temporary name, 2. detail your proposal on that page, 3. add a link with short  description to the suggestion box (link above), 4. re-name your page 'Proposal #' - replace '#' with the number matching your proposal on the list (or message me and I will rename the page for you)

Thank you!

Since there's no suggestion box page yet, and I'm concerned about the proliferation of locations for suggestions and comments, I didn't go with this option.  I'll look for a sensible place to put the suggestions, though.  Thanks for the advice.

==Tent City Map Guide?==
:[[user:scooterdudebost]] Oct 9, 2011 7:26 am
Has there been anyone to work on a map guide /layout of the tent city ? (i.e. with paths, locations, and information about the plan of the 'village' so that people can be directed to the correct tent or site?)
====re: Tent City Map Guide?====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 12, 2011 10:08 pm
i believe this has been done. i think there is a (crude) map somewhere here on the wiki, as well as on occupyboston.com.

also visit the info desk on-site - they should know where everything is!

==New GA Guide/Pictures==
:[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 8, 2011 2:15 pm
The pictures demonstrating GA hand signals are good but they really creep me out! I think I have seen a guide with really basic hand-drawn hand signals that presented all of the signals used in GA.

This page generally needs more work.
====re: New GA Guide/Pictures====
::[[user:Occupy_Boston]] Oct 9, 2011 9:38 am
I agree about the hand signals. I am going to post and see if we can get an artist on this.

==I loved &quot;War is a Racket&quot; but. . . ==
:[[user:BookofAmmon]] Oct 15, 2011 12:33 pm
. . . remember that Smedley Butler wrote this proposal in a very different geopolitical atmosphere than exists today. 

What comes to mind is the fact that Kim Jong Il's government currently has over 5,000 artillery pieces pointed directly at Seoul, South Korea, ready to turn the entire city into rubble at the opportune moment. 

While I don't like interventionism, I don't know if breaking all of our defensive treaties (this would essentially require us to drop out of NATO) is going to help our reputation abroad, nor will it necessarily make the world a safer place. 

The vast majority of our overseas holdings should be abandoned, I agree. There's no reason for us to be in Germany, the UK, Italy, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, or of course Gitmo. And Afghanistan and Iraq need to be scaled down and de-occupied pronto. The populations of these countries don't really want us or need us there. 

But the East Asian theater is still a tricky situation, and most South Koreans I've talked to are more or less glad about having us there as a deterrent.  I don't know if abandoning that defensive pact would make anybody safer (at least as long as the DPRK is still around). I don't know if the SK people would rather a conflagration start, turn into genocide, and THEN we get involved. 

So anyway, I'm just worried about how clear-cut this statement is, because each situation is different and the rules here are extremely restrictive and would probably just open the door for (even more) autocratic regimes to expand their own imperialism, because as long as whatever they do doesn't become &quot;genocide&quot; then we sit back and twiddle our thumbs. 

And again, we do find ourselves tangled in a web of alliances. It's unfortunate, but backing out on them all isn't going to improve much, from my point of view. 

Of course, it feels awkward, as a generally anti-war person, to argue this. But this statement just seems a little uncomfortably unrealistic.
====re: I loved &quot;War is a Racket&quot; but. . . ====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 16, 2011 3:52 am
I agree with the above... I'm more a fan of immediate restrictions and putting a throttle on the Dept of Defense budget than I am with a large-scope Amendment of this type.
====re: I loved &quot;War is a Racket&quot; but. . . ====
::[[user:BookofAmmon]] Oct 16, 2011 7:08 am
Here's a thought:

We should instead press for a &quot;consent of the occupied&quot; movement. As in, the US government should conduct a democratic vote of the people of a given country every five years, and THEY can decide if they want our bases to be in their countries or not. The representative governments will always be happy to let us foot the bill for protecting them, regardless of what the people of the countries think: I say we let the people of each country choose.

We are of course free to withdraw troops and bases according to our needs and finances, but this would give us a way of gracefully exiting our overseas commitments and obligations based upon the consent of the people. 

Besides, it would be real barrel of laughs having the US military hold democratic elections in places like Qatar, where the people have no democratic elections for their government! They have a hereditary monarchy! Since the bases are US territory, we'd have every right to host elections on the base: there's no need for us to pander to despots when we're giving them free protection. Give the people a taste of actual democracy and stir the pot.

==Solidarity Message from Move Your Money - Philly==
:[[user:wooriginal]] Yesterday 9:18 am
Below is a message of solidarity we received from MYM Philly.

/

MYM Boston,

On behalf of Move Your Money Philly I wanted to reach out and say hello to our friends in Boston. We stand with you 100% and are also aligned with the November 5th Bank Transfer Day.

We should have a website up soon, in the meantime here is our facebook page - http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Philadelphia-Move-Your-Money-Committee/200035733401590

Please keep me up to date as to how your efforts are coming along, all of us in MYM Philly would be very excited to hear about your success ! In the future it may also be worthwhile to share what strategies seem to work/not work. Furthermore, if you are aware of any other MYM movements in other city's perhaps we could create an email list or google group so we can help each other. You are the only other group I am currently aware of.

In Solidarity,
Adam
MYM Philly

==Credit Cards?==
:[[user:ObieBlu]] Wednesday, 8:27 pm
I haven't yet looked into it myself, but a lot of friends and acquaintances are telling me that banks are no longer offering personal debt-consolidation loans. I had one 5 years ago, and I paid it off early. it was a huge help.

I want to get my credit card debt away from Bank of America. (Debt that I accrued due to a lay-off and a year and a half of unemployment.)

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!
====re: Credit Cards?====
::[[user:chromeangel]] Wednesday, 9:00 pm
ObieBlu,

Have you spoken with a credit union about this matter?  Do you think they might be able to assist you with debt consolidation?
====re: Credit Cards?====
::[[user:ObieBlu]] Thursday, 8:33 am
I'm in the process of transferring my residency from NH to Boston, my credit union is in NH, and I haven't had a business day to go up and inquire.

I put this out there as more of a general information. I have friends who have tried, and their banks no longer offer personal loans of this nature.

Does anyone have suggestions for local Boston credit unions that they'e had success with debt-consolidation loans?

I REALLY don't want to give another cent to BoA...

:[[user:Ilove2eatVeggies]] Oct 18, 2011 10:07 am
I went to the Occupy Boston page for help to find the right bank or credit union to switch to, it led me to a site called HelloWallet. I entered my zip code and it gave me a list of banks and credit unions in the Boston area. I scrolled down the list and saw Wainwright Bank and Trust and I know that they received bailout money. I think you should let the users of the link know that the site you lead them to is not banks and credit unions that you recommend, just ones that are in thier area.

==Clean water&#039;s a good start but insufficient==
:[[user:chucklevin]] Oct 18, 2011 8:15 pm
Let us not fail to seize the moment to break down the utterly artificial barrier between the economy and the environment. The plutocracy has forever acted as though they are independent of each other with the economy always taking precedence.  Most of us in the 99% know better. We live on a finite planet with finite resources, and the economy grows only as they are depleted.  

Hence, we must redefine the terms of the debate.  Clean water is vital for a quality human life. So is clean air and preservation of biodiversity, which is aided through protection of open space, designation of Wilderness areas, and observance of &quot;smart growth&quot; strategies that strive to minimize our impact - reduce our footprint - on our land.  We must maintain large-scale life processes at the landscape level.   Social justice and environmentalism are, at the core, one and the same, and must be joined in this movement!!

So please, as we are so bravely insisting on reformulating how our structural systems work, let us insist on a new Order concerning the protection, observance, and respect for the landscape that harbors us - one species - and millions of our non-human brethren.

==Define Clean Water as a Right==
:[[user:terrawiki]] Oct 14, 2011 9:16 pm
The idea is to agree on something &quot;basic&quot;, fundamental. If we agree on &quot;that&quot;. Then move on and define things like:

- what is &quot;clean&quot;
- how much per person (does it have limits)
- how to measure

==Re-naming the group==

Renaming ourselves Mediation is currently being discussed. Thoughts?
====re: Re-naming the group====
::[[user:SashaSagan]] Oct 9, 2011 12:39 pm
My understanding is that conflict resolution can be practiced by anyone. Mediation requires a neutral outside party.

My 2 cents is that I'd rather everyone get conflict resolution skills so that trained mediators aren't necessary. Of course, those feeling expert enough who see a situation are welcome to help, just like someone with CPR doesn't need red duct tape to perform it...

Push back?
====re: Re-naming the group====
::[[user:BookofAmmon]] Oct 12, 2011 7:24 am
One issue I have with the name is mostly that it seems to focus on resolving conflicts after they happen instead of seeking to prevent them in the first place. &quot;Putting out fires&quot; is part of the picture, but it makes it seem like the group doesn't have much to do when there's not a crisis.

I mean, as boring as it sounds, &quot;Community Relations&quot; might be a better description. I'd like to see work on building, through the GA perhaps, a set of &quot;ground rules&quot; for on-site behavior to help people have the mindset to prevent conflicts in the first place, de-escalate them as they occur, and hopefully process and resolve them after the fact.
====re: Re-naming the group====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 17, 2011 2:37 pm

==Market economy==
:[[user:OccupyReality]] Today 11:48 am
You want to demand a lower cost of living?  This is a market economy, and unless you plan to change that (which would have vanishingly small support), you're not going to get price controls on everything.  And the flip side is, businesses need to make money.

I think there is a case to be made in higher education and health care for pushing for lower costs - those are fundamental services that have risen faster than general inflation for 50 years.

:[[user:bdkg]] Wednesday, 3:30 am
To do this we need to loosen regulation for smaller, business start up costs, workplace regulations, and financial assistance, that are scaled for small businesses. At the same time larger enterprises need to have regulations tightened in order to ensure that they act in the public interest and and in the interest of all stake holders

==Educating Schools - volunteers needed==
:[[user:squibbish]] Thursday, 8:20 pm
Hi friends - I'm not exactly sure where to post this, so i've posted in a couple of places. I thought there had been an &quot;education&quot; working group (gen ed isn't it) on the wiki but I can't find it, and I think this is important. If you have advice, I would appreciate it.

A friend of mine who is a student teacher is planning a field trip for his 8th grade class next Friday (and has support/blessings from his school to do this). They need guides to show them around OccupyBoston and answer questions from the kids.

Who has an interest in educating and/or knows people who could help?

They will be visiting during the morning hours of 10/28. Please message me for more details. I plan on being one of their volunteers, but  we really need 4 of us to go with small groups.

Thanks, everyone! Peace and ♥
Stephanie

==Organization for Education Section==
:[[user:yanikn]] Oct 15, 2011 10:46 am
Anyone have ideas on how to organize al this?

I took the info from the Google Doc and formatted it for the wiki. There is definitely more info that we could put here.

And maybe a link to certain sections of the SPP page? That would be considered 'education' of different types of proposals that are being considered or have at least some support by members of the movement.

I was thinking organizing by topic (economy, tax havens, wealth disparity, etc.) and then within each topic we could do it chronologically (and then books about certain topics on the bottom of each category).

Please add more if there are items because I'm sure there are many more.

Also, what about a 'required reading' or 'read this first' section? This would provide the bare essentials so that people don't have to wade through the entire index of resources.
====re: Organization for Education Section====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 15, 2011 10:04 pm
i like all of these ideas. 

we also need to really consider the correlation to the 'Press' pages, and make sure that each of these are obviously defined and remain consistent.

==This Self Serving Cause will drain support==
:[[user:WayneKleinPhD]] Oct 16, 2011 6:29 pm
I've heard negative criticisms in the media which focus on this demand.   
#1 If you went to an expensive private school - what were you thinking.

#2 Is it just for the one who received the education to get a bailout paid for with the taxes of the high school graduate?

#3 I think there is justification for the argument that those who runs up debt trying to better themselves should have as much right to declare bankruptcy as the guy who runs up debts buying toys and taking vacations they can't afford. But can anyone really seriously say that this is so pressing any issue for so many people that it demands the expenditure of political capital??
====re: This Self Serving Cause will drain support====
::[[user:occupyboston4ever]] Oct 16, 2011 8:00 pm
I have heard the criticisms in the media also.  I believe this movement can rise above such criticism if it were to get its argument straight.  Much of the issue these protesters face is looming student debt at a time of high unemployment.  There is no doubt the the government and the federal reserve have highly encouraged the accumulation of student debt, yet has failed to deliver a functioning job market.  I believe this entitles students to demand debt relief.  I say this having paid tuition out of my own pocket by working through college, so this taxpayer is willing to foot the bill.

I do not believe individuals who have taken out personal debt should get the same relief.  There is no public responsibility for acquiring personal possessions as there is for education.

I see your point about declaring bankruptcy.  Under bankruptcy student loan debt is not forgiven.  There are arguments in favor of this practice, yet it makes no sense that other debts may be written off.
====re: This Self Serving Cause will drain support====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 17, 2011 4:15 am
It's $1T in self-acquired investment costs that will, for at least 3/4 of people, result in dramatic returns on investment.

The issue is employment, not debt.
====re: This Self Serving Cause will drain support====
::[[user:StargazerA]] Oct 17, 2011 9:32 am
Since this revolution probably wouldn't be happening if it were for the large number of debt-ridden youth who can't find jobs, I certainly think it is important enough to concern ourselves with.

The other major issue is outstanding housing debt, which is even more self-serving.  College is not longer optional for many if not most desirable careers, whereas renting was, for a long period, cheaper than buying a house even after the massive government subsidy of the rich through the mortgage interest tax deduction.

The problem isn't just private schools, either.  $30,000 in debt from an in-state state school is not uncommon, particularly with unemployment as high as it is and the difficulty in getting side employment.

We need fairer bankruptcy laws all around, ones that aren't written by the creditors.  We also need available, accessible and cheap higher education: it will lead to innovation, entrepreneurship, an educated work force and GDP growth.  Education spending benefits the nation as a whole, not just those who go to college.

These aren't unimportant side-issues.  If it weren't for student debt the current unemployment among graduates wouldn't be as devastating.  They'd move back in with their parents until the economy picked up again.  Because of debt, that isn't an option: they are loosing money every minute they are out of work.  Their credit is being ruined as we speak, which will hobble real estate markets for years to come. 

They deserve our help.  It's not even that hard: if we want college funding to be indentured servitude we should just make it explicit and charge some percentage of earnings for the first 15 or 30 years after graduation.  If we don't, we need to stop funding it through loans and start funding higher education through the same progressive tax system as other socially-beneficial programs.
====re: This Self Serving Cause will drain support====
::[[user:reyraton]] Thursday, 3:42 pm
I think partial forgiveness through bankruptcy proceedings is a decent middle ground, but total forgiveness for a debt incurred as an investment with full awareness of costs is unpalatable.

I mean, if the economy was booming I don't think this would be an issue, would it? With that in mind, I think employment is the real driver of this issue.

Moving forward, I think that addressing and subsidizing future education costs is worth drafting a proposal over, but already-incurred costs doesn't resonate with me...

...but I'm just one dude. :)

==Where is the money?==
:[[user:OccupyReality]] Oct 16, 2011 7:27 am
It is one thing to work towards making existing institutions more affordable.  I agree it costs way too much to go to college these days.

As far as making higher education a right, I have three comments:
- the money isn't there, and even in Europe, where heavy taxes supported this, it's on the chopping block, and we are in a deep recession
- not everyone needs a college education
- not everyone is cut out for a college education
====re: Where is the money?====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 17, 2011 4:16 am
An education is necessary these days, but I think, given the cash reality, that the above is correct.

Work on improving the K-12 system is a better, cheaper use of money.

==Solutions beyond debt==
:[[user:reyraton]] Oct 16, 2011 3:56 am
I'm wary of completely writing off student debt; it's $1T and the result of agreements made by people who could presumably add. ARM mortgages could be conceptualized as tricky and obscure, but student debt isn't like that.

I feel like the root cause is the unemployment rate, not magnitude of debt.

==Organizing Media links==
:[[user:LauraGail67]] Oct 8, 2011 2:46 pm
Currently it looks like these links are by date. It seems like it would be helpful to have the articles separated into general occupation articles (as in Wall Street and other cities), and those which focus primarily/exclusively on Boston. Anyone have an opinion on this?
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:Occupy_Boston]] Oct 8, 2011 5:58 pm
I think that for now we should focus on articles mostly pertaining to OccupyBoston because that is a more manageable project.

And then yes, a separate section for general occupation articles (although that will be a sea of info).
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:life_panels]] Oct 8, 2011 6:23 pm
Hi folks,
I just started the table with the external text. It seems there are others working on it too, now? Someone just added a commentary section. I just started doing this on my own. Should I not have?
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:life_panels]] Oct 8, 2011 6:29 pm
I see there are a couple of image posts that should be transferred to the ext images section.

I had just looked over the list of links and tried to find a different way to group them and the why, who, what, and how idea came to me.
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:Occupy_Boston]] Oct 8, 2011 6:36 pm
life_panels. Thanks for organizing. I sent a private message too. I think we should include a commentary section, but also create different tables by date.

This will facilitate editing/re-arranging the content in the cells of the table.
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:life_panels]] Oct 8, 2011 6:41 pm
Hi, O_B
I've been trying to do them by date as I put them into the categories but I'm having a hard time time getting each post to embed into the cell I'm pointing it to. 

I do like the commentary section idea, too.
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:Occupy_Boston]] Oct 8, 2011 7:55 pm
Quick question, what does 'post' mean? Why did you choose to go away from the why, what, how categories?

It looks great, By the way.
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:life_panels]] Oct 8, 2011 8:40 pm
I wasn't sure how to label the links that are posted. You can change it if you'd like. Articles? Stories? Links? 

I could still do the why what and how categories, but I thought it would make the tables too spread out and leave too many cells empty. 

I have a couple of links to straighten out but I'm bushed! I'll come back tomorrow and fix them. If you'd like I can help with more on this site tomorrow.

Have a good night.
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:LauraGail67]] Oct 8, 2011 8:41 pm
Looks great! 
What would be going into the &quot;commentary&quot; cell? Would that be tags or a note as to what the general thrust of the article is? (supportive/mocking/critical)
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:Occupy_Boston]] Oct 8, 2011 9:00 pm
I think we should get rid of commentary, actually. There isn't enough article. And let's change it to 'articles.'

Great work, life_panels! Thanks you.
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:life_panels]] Oct 9, 2011 8:47 am
Good morning, folks,
There are still image articles at the bottom of the page. Should there be another section under media for Ext. Photography?
====re: Organizing Media links====
::[[user:Occupy_Boston]] Oct 9, 2011 10:08 pm
Yes. The Ext. Photography should be photography by traditional media organizations with the subject matter being solely Occupy Boston.

==Resource for finding the news!==

==Proposal for GA Proposal Submission - consented by FWG, on 10/20/11==
:[[user:gsmurphy]] Thursday, 6:25 pm
This proposal will be presented to a public working group, for consensus, before being presented at a GA:

To strive for an inclusive consensus process, to allow the Assembly to be more informed about, and better prepared for hearing and voting on proposals, to help OccupyBoston participants to be able to plan to be at specific General Assemblies to vote on proposals of interest, and to better the likelihood of passage ....

The Facilitators Working Group proposes that pre-announced, pre-posted, pre-scheduled proposals which have had publicly announced meetings and passed consensus at a public working group meeting, will be considered prior to other proposals, at General Assemblies. Working Groups and individuals may still bring proposals to the GA, without submitting to this new process. Emergency proposals, e.g., from Safety, Medics, Legal, etc., will continue to get immediate attention.

The Facilitators Working Group proposes the following process for preparing proposals to be taken through consensus at a General Assembly:

1.    First Steps (at least one week prior to presenting at GA):
○    post the proposal on the OccupyBoston wiki and make physical copies available at camp;
○    schedule and post online, the date of the GA at which the proposal will be presented;
○    do outreach to all Working Groups to let them know you have a proposal in the pipeline and would like their input;
○    schedule and post online, the date of a public working group meeting, at which the proposal will be reviewed and taken through the consensus process. (Individuals can host meetings, they simply become a working group once the meeting begins.)
2.    Announce at the earliest possible evening GA: 
○    that you are preparing a proposal,
○    the subject of the proposal and that it is posted online,
○    the date, time and location of the public working group meeting, 
○    and the date the proposal will be presented to the GA.
3.    Conduct a full consensus Working Group meeting:
○    Document all objections and amendments, 
○    Explain how objections were addressed,
(Objections must remain on a public list so that if the proposal cannot address them, and is still consented to, the community knows that there are outstanding concerns/objections to address.)
○    Explain whether or why not amendments were adopted. 
4.    If the proposal has passed consensus in the public working group meeting, present the proposal at the pre-scheduled GA.
5.    If the proposal did not reach consensus at the public working group meeting, post that result online and announce at the next available GA that the proposal will not be presented on the previously scheduled date.
====re: Proposal for GA Proposal Submission - consented by FWG, on 10/20/11====
::[[user:anonyta]] Today 1:24 am
Hi all,

The proposal below emerges from a tough Transparency WG meeting and from conversations with some of the most active people on-site -- the people who don't attend meetings and GAs (to their detriment, of course - but, also, to ours). Basically, there are big problems with internet access and a lot of frustration about the aimlessness of some GAs. I floated it in this past Facilitation meeting and got some advice on it from Maureen and others. Tell me what you think!

The proposal: that agendas (of proposals! not announcements) for GA nights should be decided on the night before, in a small, consensus-based discussion between the individuals and WG reps presenting proposals. On Friday night that small discussion will decide the proposals agenda for both Saturday and Sunday. The idea is for presenters to figure out together which proposals need to be discussed most immediately, versus those that can be discussed by a smaller group or even moved to the next GA or re-worked. A facilitator can facilitate the discussion and gather the proposals and put them on the wiki or on occupybostonglobe.com, so that commuters as well as campers know what proposals will be discussed, and in what order.

Talking Points
-- I offer to do this, and recruit some facilitators for it, since I am free on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays more than on Tuesdays and Thursdays (in fact, I teach on those nights).
--This face-to-face consensus decision would eliminate the problem of internet access, but still allow for some level of predictability and preparation for everybody.
--It would also, ideally, highlight the proposals that are not yet worked out enough, in a consensus environment.
--after the Transparency meeting and these various conversations with campers, I realized that Allison's proposal for proposals, which we passed in the previous FWG meeting, relies too heavily on the internet. It will guarantee that the WGs whose members are mostly working off-site are always given priority, over those who are on-site. So, for example, groups or individuals that are talking about &quot;Message&quot; will be given priority, over those that are organizing events that often come up within the week, or those that need money within the week. At the moment, we don't have the kind of stability that would allow WGs to prepare proposals for a week - especially with winter coming, it seems that things are much more in flux for groups that organize events.
--Ironically, in a lot of those conversations, people were basically saying that they wanted us Facilitators to use more of our common sense, to vet proposals in order for GAs to be bearable. For the good of the community and etc.

Well, do let me know what you think! Allison, what do you think about the modification that this makes to your proposal??
====re: Proposal for GA Proposal Submission - consented by FWG, on 10/20/11====
::[[user:pcovery]] Today 4:44 am
I welcome more organization, especially in a way that knits together on-site and off-site participants.  Thanks for your stamina in facilitating!

==CORRECTED GA Schedule Consented Proposal - 10/21/11==
:[[user:gsmurphy]] Yesterday 5:06 am
The Facilitators Working Group (FWG) proposes, starting on Sunday, October 23, that OccupyBoston move to a schedule of conducting General Assembly on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, and in case of emergencies.

The FWG proposes that all Working Groups hold at least one publicly accessible, weekly meeting -- except Legal WG, whose meetings are necessarily confidential. The day and time and place of the meeting is to be posted on the OccupyBoston website, and made available to the Info tent and the Media scheduling boards. The meeting will be facilitated as a horizontal democracy using a consensus decision-making process. During the non-GA evenings, there will be facilitated discussions and debates starting 7pm, on issues that interest the Occupy Boston community. Topics for these non-GA nights should be proposed in advance by individuals or Working Groups during General Assembly.

The FWG offers its services to all Working Groups who wish to be trained in a consensus process, and, if needed, can help Working Groups with the facilitation of their first scheduled public meeting.
====re: CORRECTED GA Schedule Consented Proposal - 10/21/11====
::[[user:gsmurphy]] Yesterday 5:19 am
Actually, the proposal was consented to by the GA, on 10/20/11

==Final GA Schedule Proposal - consented by GA on 10/20/11==
:[[user:gsmurphy]] Thursday, 6:20 pm
The Facilitators Working Group (FWG) proposes, starting on Sunday, October 23, that OccupyBoston move to a schedule of conducting General Assembly on Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

The FWG proposes that all Working Groups hold at least one publicly accessible, weekly meeting, during one of the non-GA evenings, or on a weekend afternoon. The day and time and place of the meeting is to be posted on the OccupyBoston website, and made available to the Info tent and the Media scheduling boards. The meeting will be facilitated as a horizontal democracy using a consensus decision-making process.

The FWG offers its services to all Working Groups who wish to be trained in a consensus process, and, if needed, can help Working Groups with the facilitation of their first scheduled public meeting.


Talking points
• FWG knows that members of OccupyBoston are yearning for more public (community-wide) discussion on relevant topics. This new GA schedule allows plenty of opportunity for these discussions, as well as community teach-ins and workshops, without a sponsoring group having to go through a GA consensus process to arrange the time.

• For example, this new schedule allows groups, such as the anti-oppression group, to present additional workshops, on an ongoing basis, without impacting GA time.

• This new schedule would allow for Working Groups to attract broader participation from Boston residents who do not live at that camp and who are not available during the day, via meetings held during early evening hours, without interfering with and/or drawing people away from GA.

• This new schedule allows the FWG much needed meeting time to address other facilitation and communication needs, and to develop and schedule facilitator trainings and Introduction to consensus decision-making workshops.

• Let us remember and recognize that this global movement, of which occupyboston is the local realization, is steeped in horizontal democracy and the consensus process. It is the cornerstone, if not the foundation of how it operates - all voices are equal and everyone gets to listen and comment.

• As Facilitators, we are the protectors and champions (as many of you are, as well) of these guiding principles and we hope to inculcate the consensus practice throughout OB, and not simply have it be seen as a GA management tool.

I'm trying to figure out what needs to change in how we regulate corporations. I guess 'personhood' means you can make an agreement with a corporation, sue them, they can buy buildings and stuff in the name of their corporation. What would we replace that with? Would the board of directors be jointly liable for every corporate event? stockholders? workers?
====re: a person is a human====
::[[user:occupyboston4ever]] Oct 13, 2011 2:45 pm
these are good questions.  There are a lot of groups out there who are devoted to taking on these issues.  However, the problem is that corporations are protected under the 14th amendment.  Corporate Personhood is a giant obstacle to all that this movement stands for.  So the law needs to be changed before we can reevaluate the rights of corporations.

In contrast, I do not think it is wise to let a bad law stand, and then add regulations to fix the problems of the bad law.  Get rid of the bad law, and then create good laws to replace it.  So we would have to fight for the creation of those good laws, which we CAN do.  But we CAN'T fight for good laws without disposing of bad laws.
====re: a person is a human====
::[[user:occupyboston4ever]] Oct 13, 2011 2:54 pm
If you want to think about what needs to be changed, the responsibility of corporate employees and stockholders needs to be evaluated.

Corporate role in media needs to be addressed.

Anti-trust laws need to be strengthened.

Campaign finance needs to be addressed.

Corporate lobbying needs to be addressed.

Government subsidies to large corporations need to be addressed.
====re: a person is a human====
::[[user:Stewart76]] Oct 15, 2011 9:18 pm
The purpose of setting up a corporation is to limit liability, if you screw up as an agent of the corporation, only the corporation can be sued.  There is no personal liability or accountability.  No one is responsible because everyone is responsible.  The corporation is designed for this.  But in addition to occupys list, we should also think about ways to encourage and reward corporate whistle blowers.

DSWS, you should check in with the media tent at Dewey square because unfortunately that post wasn't very clear on who to contact and what exactly needed to be done. My guess is that you will also want to talk with the Strategy Policy and Planning Group for this particular project. Once you've made contact if you could post the basics of what needs to be done so other can start working remotely.

Well, that was a long T ride to accomplish nothing.  The people at the media tent, as of noon, weren't aware of anything they need volunteers for.  They have nothing to do with remote anything, and haven't even read the web page.

That is so odd because they posted the original post calling for volunteers in the first place.

Also, they just posted this address on the website. volunteeroccupybos@gmail.com

Try that.

Hi dsws thanks for joining.

I'm not surprised there is confusion at this early state. On the ground in the moment the camp i really good at getting things done without directed leadership. Achieving the same across different &quot;shifts&quot; of people will likely continue to be a challenge for the short term. 

From talking to a few key folks we have quite a few needs and we are looking toward donations and such to fill those. 

Finance i think in this particular scenario I think is an area to start to figure out how to actively fill these needs either by acquiring necessary funding or other alternative means. 

Some things that might be nice is to identify some of the more expensive things the camp could use and try to organize some funding to squire those items or borrow them.

Hey jmagly,
Alex I. from Media has been looking around the wikispaces site, he's a good contact. The rest of them still think OB=what the press says about us so they have their eyes glued to Twitter/Fbook (and not to wikispaces and GA and Working Groups). It'd be great if you get on Tech Working Group's radar, occupybostontech@gmail.com, because they have been handling a lot of the internal communications. Mike K has also offered to help with wikispaces. if you can make the Thursday 9pm Transparency Working Group Meeting, with liaisons from all the Working Groups, that would be great. Wiki-training is a major step towards getting internal communications between WG's sorted out.

====re: Page cleanup====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Wednesday, 10:18 am
this is awesome.

is it possible to keep a direct link on the main page to every individual ga, rather than summarizing the older ones into sets? at this point in time we don't have a large inventory, so i feel truncation is not necessary. eventually we will have many, and perhaps we can put them into sets of 30 or 50? perhaps the occupation will provide events by which we can create 'eras.' this way a few details on each ga within the current 'era' can be listed, as well as older sets, which could have a few important points as well. does that make sense?

if you think so, go for it.

also, i removed the embedded vids on the main and put them into their respective places as they were dated. the qr code unfortunately links to a deleted page, so it was deleted.
====re: Page cleanup====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Wednesday, 10:21 am
should we move the day of the week to the end of the link so that the month and number appear first?
====re: Page cleanup====
::[[user:jmagly]] Wednesday, 1:31 pm
I'm cool with both ideas. I would recommend splitting the difference with the weeklies. In general once you go beyond 3-5 pages people reading the oldest entries drops off significantly while having grouped links encourages more review of older archived. 

Mainly because this wiki is viewed both by the public and by regular users/editors. Long pages make it more difficult for the public coming by to see whats going on.

Perhaps something like this

Month Day, Year - GA# @Location
Summary Point 1Summary Point 2Summary Point 3......

(One or 2 summary point(s) per major topic including those without resolution)

Week # - Month Day to Month Day, Year - GA# X to Y
Weekly Summary Point 1Weekly Summary Point 2Weekly Summary Point 3.....

(One Summary point per day short list of achieved/passed resolutions)


Let me know your thoughts, I'm flexible to what the group needs, just wanted to toss some ideas out there.
====re: Page cleanup====
::[[user:]] 
            
          
Oh yes and summary points may have 2 formats

Short and to the point:

Basic summary point one or 2 lines
Expanded summary point

Summary Point Topic&gt;&gt;This is an expanded list of summary point information for resolutions the group would like to call out in detail on the main page. This may be a paragraph or more, may contain multimedia or other relevant links/embedded content.

==GA Minute Pages ---&gt; as Google Docs!==
:[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 8, 2011 11:51 am
This is all well and good, but MUST become standard practice.
Along with making standard practice, we MUST create a SIMPLE and SHORT tag for these pages. We have FAR TOO MANY pages already and organizing them is a HUGE HASSLE because there appears to be no 'FOLDERS' but rather 'TAGS' with which to organize the navigation.

We need to present a CONCISE wiki for both #Occupiers and those #OnTheFence who come here to see what it's all about! This is part of OUTREACH, so we need to make sure it LOOKS PROFESSIONAL.

I am ALL FOR making MINUTES, but perhaps these could be posted as GOOGLE DOCS so that the wiki has a SINGLE GA Minutes page that links to the detailed docs.

Please reply to this discussion or go to your wikispaces.com home page and send a message to me 'onekarma'

^^Does this work?
====re: GA Minute Pages ---&gt; as Google Docs!====
::[[user:Occupy_Boston]] Oct 8, 2011 6:03 pm
Another option is to embed the existing Google sites/docs page that it seems is being used to post the minutes (at least one version of minutes that is currently up).

The problem with this is that you are dependent on an external source and you can't organize the GA minutes the way you want to. Data redundancy is good. Also they might not be organizing the minutes in the most optimal form.
====re: GA Minute Pages ---&gt; as Google Docs!====
::[[user:intensely_human]] Oct 10, 2011 8:17 am
This is a good idea, and one that could be generalized:  

Any time there is a process that will be continuously generating new wiki content (in this case, GA minutes that come in every day), special consideration should be put into keeping it from creating a steadily-growing number of wiki peages.

==usability==
:[[user:intensely_human]] Oct 7, 2011 5:59 pm
I'm splitting minutes into one page for each GA.  That page will have three sections (for now, until we think of more):  &quot;passed resolutions&quot; first for easy reference, &quot;full minutes&quot; which are all the minutes from the meeting, and &quot;video&quot; for video of the GA.

Thoughts?

==Proposed Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation==

This is a work in progress, submitted here for review as decided upon by the GA on 10/13. Hopefully this can be presented soon, with any appropriate friendly amendments and corrections added into it:

Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation

The times in which we live confront us with a combination of crises the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, economic, social, and environmental messes that demands a radical clean-up. While each of these crises has its own determinants, they also all share a common root cause: the domination of our social, economic, and political order by a system designed to serve a wealthy elite, at the expense of the vast majority of the population, here and around the world, not to mention other living creatures on this planet. In light of these interlocking crises, the stench of which we can no longer stand, crises which threaten our lives, our livelihoods, our liberty, our human values, and our common future, We, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, believe that &quot;business as usual&quot; is no longer an option. The corrupt order, and the intolerable crises amidst which we live demand a profound, collective response, a popular and participatory response of the sort the ruling elite can neither allow, nor even imagine:

Whereas, the problems of economic inequality, unemployment, crushing debt, as well as corporate personhood, greed, and unaccountability, are all symptomatic of the larger corrupting influence money has on our political and social lives,

Whereas, this influence has consistently been used to impede progress toward a more just and sustainable society, and has often perpetuated crisis and war at home and abroad in furtherance of its own undemocratic agenda,

Whereas, those wielding this influence also own and control the media we require to inform ourselves about their many abuses of money and power,

And whereas, our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan resistance,

Be it resolved that we, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, acting in solidarity with occupations across America and with peoples' movements worldwide, do hereby declare our opposition to all systems of power that function to maintain these oppressive and undemocratic arrangements, just as we declare our affirmation in the belief that a better world is possible, and that it is our right and responsibility to begin creating it.
====re: Proposed Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation====
::[[user:bugmagnet]] Oct 14, 2011 3:41 pm
Hi,

I am new to Occupy Boston,  and I really like what you wrote.  However it seems very general.  For example these wonderful statements could easily be co-opted by Obama or Republicans to further the status quo in the name of change, instead of actually fixing anything.  After all it was &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;  we earned when they flushed proposals for universal single payer health care down the toilet.  Then we were told how grateful we should be for that.
What do you think of adding an amendment with specific demands?  Here are my suggestions:
- Public financing of elections
- Criminalization of any type of gift giving to politicians while in office and for a minimum of 4 years after leaving office.
- A Constitutional amendment that bans corporate personhood.  This should include organizations of all types.  Only people are people.
- A universal, single payer health care system that covers all Americans,  with the expectation that this will be paid for with new tax revenue.
- Criminalize health insurance as a for-profit enterprise
- An end to the Drug War
- Quarterly audit of the Federal Reserve Bank
- Nationalization of the Federal Reserve Bank
- Peg the minimum wage to inflation
- Tax capital gains at minimum 50%
- Socialize all our prison systems, and criminalize prison administration as a for-profit enterprise.
- Peg congressional pay to the average salary of Americans, including benefits.
- Cut in half the current level of annual military spending
- Abolish the CIA as a secret organization, merging it with the state department and military.
====re: Proposed Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation====
::[[user:JSkeet]] Oct 14, 2011 10:19 pm
The purpose of this was to simply be a declaration of occupation. I feel it's important to get a document like this out as soon as possible, and we're closer to doing this than we are in coalescing around a set of demands, so we realistically should separate the two and try to pass something like this now. 

Also I'll use this opportunity to post a recent revision: I just realized that we promised the inner city youth, in a consensus decision at GA, that we would recognize the different plights of different segments of the 99% in our statement. With that in mind, here is a slightly revised declaration, with the revision happening in the 3rd whereas statement: 

Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation

The times in which we live confront us with a combination of crises the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, economic, social, and environmental messes that demands a radical clean-up.

Whereas, this influence has consistently been used to impede progress toward a more just and sustainable society, and has often perpetuated crisis and war at home and abroad in furtherance of its own undemocratic agenda,

Whereas, the perusal of this agenda has had profound detrimental effects on all working and middle class communities - and particularly on communities of color, youth, and other marginalized segments of our population – as well as on the environmental systems upon which we as a species depend,

Whereas, those pursuing this agenda also own and control the media we require to inform ourselves about their many abuses of money and power,

And whereas, our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan our resistance,

::[[user:panagiotis1]] Oct 15, 2011 7:38 pm
The following statement was written as a complement to Skeet's declaration, and is thus in the same spirit. It is also a work in progress. There are elements in both that can be incorporated into a powerful declaration of the occupation.

We, Occupy Boston, are building a broad alliance of the discontented, the dispossessed, the alienated, and the exploited. As the 99%, we declare that the 1% will not make us pay for their crisis and will no longer corrupt the democratic process, depriving it of its significance. It is the democratic process that we seek to broaden and strengthen, letting people affirm their dignity by taking their lives and the wealth they create into their own hands, for the liberation of labor and humanity and for the progression to a more equitable and just society. As a precondition for the real democracy that we seek to establish, it is necessary that all individuals – irrespective of their race, sex, age, creed, skin color, or immigration status – are secured a decent level of healthcare, education, housing, income, and employment or retirement security so that they may participate meaningfully in the popular processes that we are developing in occupied squares throughout the United States.

We thus declare the urgent need for a society in which priority is placed on the free social and cultural development of all individuals, not on the maximization of capitalists’ profits, in which public goods and social services are once more brought into the sphere of the commons, and in which workers democratically control the process of production, so that decisions regarding the allocation and distribution of our resources are made in a participatory and inclusive manner in the broader interests of our society.

In solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, the peoples of Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Chile, and all those participating in this global uprising

==Proposed Statement of Being and Solidarity==
:[[user:Lexikon]] Oct 14, 2011 7:48 am
I think we can all agree we're badly in need of a statement that
reflects the group, but isn't incendiary, at the same time offering
support for the movement and making it clear that it's not a demand of any kind.

There were some statements floating around the SPP message board written by groups or individuals and I liked them, but since we need only one and we should all have a hand in crafting it, I combined them, and added my own 0.02 as well.

It's pasted below, feel very free to rip it apart, edit it, add to it,
reject it, etc. etc.


When a people become beholden to a broken form of governance, they will rise up and fight for the rights appropriated to them as human beings, even as an empire crumbles around them. The American people’s pursuit of life, liberty and happiness has become impeded by a government that no longer operates in the best interests of its people. 

Once the land of freedom, opportunity, free thought, and growth, the United States sits besieged by economic calamity and oppression, the results of an inept system controlled by a fiscally influential minority that allowed corporate and personal greed to place priority on profits over people. 

We, Occupy Boston, stand together with all Americans and in solidarity with the growing Occupy movement, here and abroad, as the beginning of a global, echoing, chant of dissatisfaction and dissent with these policies. 

The current system can no longer be trusted to reform itself, as it was wrought to do, as those elected to lead us have neglected their duty to the people by failing to address the crises we face today. 

When 1% of the population controls the destinies of the other 99%, great and fundamental changes must be made in order to preserve our civic well-being. We believe in the creative ability of the people to look beyond paradigm and systemic prejudice to address and solve the problems we face. 

Therefore, Occupy Boston is engaging a dialogue to foster a national debate using a directly democratic model, which will identify problems and manifest solutions. 

The path toward a just society is clear and we, the people, declare our intent to stand and demand a relief from oppression and a regress for grievances levied against a government that has allowed a subversion of the rights of the citizens of this democracy. 

Whereas we are a diverse group but cannot yet represent all people in all places, and whereas our democratic process is both pure and thorough, we intend to issue future statements, but will make no further announcements on our collective purpose until a time when we are able to reach a consensus reflective of all individual issues, concerns and ideas of this body. 

We stand united. We are the 99%.

Taxation, far from being a bureaucratic scam to steal our hard-won earnings by some alien “them” or “it,” is the way citizens pool resources to do public things together they can’t do alone. Attacking the power to tax is attacking the power of the people to spend their money in concert to achieve important public goals, whether national defense, public education or social justice. The anti-tax ideologues pretend to protect us, but in truth they disempower us.

I do agree and would like to take it a step further and say that in the past we society had a need for leaders (&quot;monarchs&quot;, now leaders by many names) to help in the co-ordination of those resources. Simple logistics of previous era's required this type of structure due to limitations on education and communication among the populace. 

As our population grew more and more layers are placed between the many who pool their resources and the few that control it. 

We are fortunate that in this day in age we have created amazing technologies that allow the &quot;common&quot; person to obtain information and communicate with others in increasingly rich detail. 

Further we have, through public funding, created an educated citizenry that is capable of rational thought and achieving balanced solutions to problems we collectively face if we are provided the right framework (culture/technology/education) with which to have the conversation.

As a result we as a people are better equipped to take more direct control of our society and the how we allocate our collective resources and policy. 

Taxation is absolutely necessary for a functioning society at this stage. The people however, require more transparency and control over how we spend that money.

I believe that taxation in its traditional sense - i.e. under a king who would pocket the money, has obtained a bad rap. In a normally functioning democratic republic taxes are a manner in which we can help to build a better society for all - through shared sacrifice. As a society taxes should be used to build roads, bridges, schools, educate, enable social mobility, and provide opportunity. They should be used to help the unfortunate to build better lives, etc. Thats not what is happening today. Taxes are being used to subsidize already super wealthy corporations, bail out banks, pay off dictators to like us, and other strange things that dont help the majority of struggling Americans. Today we have a form of taxation without representation... consider this. If we pay taxes, but our elected officials are beholden to those who can donate the most in campaign contributions - then are they really representing you? No... because they are addicted to money - through campaign contributions - in order to remain in office, your interests arent considered when voting on legislation. Instead the &quot;person&quot; (more like corporation) who can front the money for the next election (typically special interest groups supported by big business) essentially BUY legislation. So we have a form of taxation without representation. 

Furthermore, a far more complex form of taxation without representation, are the externalities of deregulated businesses. Pollution is technically a tax on the future, so is underfunding education, the inflated price of goods, income disparities, and the cost of oligopolies/monopolies/collusion, and price fixing. Its time we begin to educate ourselves about these issues - and speak about them. &quot;No Taxation without Honest Representation&quot;! Keep up the good fight!

Taxation, and submitting to laws, are the price that one pays to live in an orderly and civil society.

Having said that, this doesn't mean that all taxes are good or that more is necessarily better.

You need to weigh the costs against the benefits, both direct and indirect, to all of society.

::[[user:gregking3]] Yesterday 4:35 am
Hi, Everybody.  I'm a rank-and-file member of SEIU, local 888.  I'm much older than most folks taking part in Occupy Boston.  I was 19 in 1969, at the height of the movement to end the Vietnam war.  I came out to Hawaii the year before that as a devout Roman Catholic, quite comservative in my views, but was quite deeply affected by the courage of young people like me in deserting the armed froces,resisting the draft and in other ways opposing the Vietnam war.  I took some courses (I was going to the University of Hawaii) and did a lot of talking with the young resisters, as well as a lot of thinking about what my country was doing in Vietnam.  I gradually became a radical Catholic and joined The Hawaii Resistance, a group affiliated with the War Resisters League.  Joining my new friends in leafleting servicemen on R &amp; R in Waikiki, I talked with all kinds of people, including a young CIA agent, who told me he was against the Vietnam war, but was all for &quot;the coming war in Thailand, because the Thai peasants love their king.&quot;  I helped organize the &quot;grunts&quot; (rank-and-file US soldiers sent to Vietnam) and, with everybody working together, we soon had 37 deserters in sanctuary at four local churches in Honolulu.  We got some of them undeground to Canada and Sweden.  The rest got busted in a predawn raid by the HASP (Hawaii Armed Services Police).  Our sanctuary had lasted two months, though, and those 37 deserters had bravely taken a stand against further participation in the killing.

We dreamed of revolution because, like you, we saw the root of war in the financial system skewed against ordinary people and driven by an &quot;expand-or-die&quot; logic.  We were nonviolent.  Like my friends, I pictured hundreds of thousands of people sitting down on Wall Street, on 
Pennsylvania Avenue and at the Pentagon, bringing an end to &quot;business as usual.&quot;  But I had seen the authorities do such things as slam a whole row of metal benches into the ribs of a friend when we were blocking the 29th Brigade from getting on planes for Vietnam.  I had visions of truncheons coming down on the heads and bodies of men, women and children I had grown to love, if we really did try to &quot;throw our bodies onto the machine,&quot; as Mario Savio had advised at Berkeley in '64 during the Free Speech Movement.  I couldn't bear such images of friends being bloodied, so I joined SDS and began to study Marxism.  I still wanted peaceful change in my heart of hearts.  I envisioned our joining and organizing in the armed forces, so that instead of firing on the people, those soldiers would &quot;turn their guns around.&quot;  If they did, they might not have to fire them.

I've remained committed to social change that's as bloodless as possible my whole life.  I strongly believe in the rights and the self-empowerment of working people, so I have been a labor activist for a long time.  I remain one.  I want to see people taking steps to free themselves by freeing their minds at first, and realizing they CAN do certain things, like speak up for themselves and take action to change their situation.

I'd like to see people do that not just in their workplaces, but in the larger society, as well.  That's why I've been a member of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism (CCDS), since it was foounded in December 1991.  CCDS believes in organizing what we see as the Progressive Majority toward a democratic and socialist future for our country and, if other peoples in other lands do their own things toward similar goals, for the world, as well.  We think only under a democratic socialism can we have a more just, more sustainable world, in which working people control both their own workplaces and the larger society, and we use green technology, green heating and cooling and transportation, for a greener world.

You folks have started something big at Occupy Boston, Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Chicago, Occupy Los Angeles, etc.  It's now spreading all over the wolrd, and, of course, it started in Teheran, Tunis, Tahrir Square, Madison, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Oakland, etc.  Maybe together we can make the bankers pay, keep people in their homes, make education free and build a more just society.

Let's discuss these things.  Think about joining our efforts.  i am not speaking for Boston CCDS. I am speaking for myself, but I am a member of Boston CCDS.  I want everybody who believes there can and will be a better world to get together, though.  You can do it through CCDS or you can do it in whatever other way you choose. 

              In solidarity,
               Greg King

::[[user:Sage.Rad]] Yesterday 11:41 am
I'm a 30-something carpenter who works for the moment as a bioelectrochemical engineer on green fuels, studied sociology/anthropology, worked for human rights in Nepal.

I love Thoreau and individualism. I love thinking for myself, and I love people who do that too. I distrust anything that ends in &quot;-ist&quot; that has to do with politics. I distrust any dogma. I think that people are basically good and will help each other out happily, but also don't exactly call myself an anarchist or  socialist or anything. Too much baggage. Look at the situation afresh. Go with intuition, employ reason but stay on the side of love. Take your time. Listen to all voices as if they might be right. Talk to people who disagree with you. Treat people with respect as long as possible.

I want to be at Occupy Boston more than I have been. I'm busy working, in the system that has kept me in debt, in a form of servitude, for too long even though I work hard all the time for myself and for others.

What I wish for the politics of Occupy Boston is for it to avoid the empty commodified forms of politics that we've been taught to think of as &quot;politics&quot;. I want something vibrant and real, something that is real because it relates directly to daily life ... from smiling at strangers, talking with people you wouldn't otherwise talk with, taking radically new views on life and society, imagining a world that's not dominated from the top as this present one is. I imagine a world where economy is at a human scale, people can grow their own food, find a place to live on the land, breathe clean air, have amazing discussions and love each other well.

What I do NOT wish for is tables about socialist parties, pamphlets about Kropotkin, lifestyle hangout scenes -- either Bonnaroo-style or red-and-black Zapatista wannabe style, or anyone serving their egos. That may all have its place but in my opinion Dewey Square is not the place to be like that because it hurts the movement from appealing to the as-yet-undecided part of the exploited 99% who love the aesthetics of the 1%. There is time. Slowly space will open up. There are other spaces, too, in this world for all of that. I look to the Civil Rights Movement, and to Gandhi's movement to free India from the British. I want to rely on the simple idea of &quot;You know it's wrong. If you look at it, you know it's wrong&quot; as the motive power for the movement's success. The most basic human-level knowledge of the heart, that can move my grandma as well as a radical-leaning teenager.

I also think that a lot of what the movement can accomplish is through the process itself, not any stated end goals. By being radically democratic, by solving practical problems like electricity and sanitation in cooperative and inspiring ways, and by having a fun and inclusive atmosphere that makes people want to be a part of it. I think it can be contagious, like an epidemic of hope.  Was this on topic? Maybe enough.

Boston is filled with skilled dancers from diverse ethnic backgrounds. How would people feel about a show with performances that demonstrate different dances from around the world?

==Statement of purpose draft==
:[[user:DavidKeil]] Oct 14, 2011 8:23 am
The Strategy, Proposals, and Positions working group has been discussing drafting of a statement of the aims of Occupy Boston to present to the GA. Here is one short draft submitted. It consists of the headings from a statement issued by Occupy Madison. I think it's a good place to start. By putting its collective purposes in writing for the public, Occupy Boston can reach out to unions and community groups.



1. A fair and just economic system that benefits all humanity not solely the 1%, including but not limited to substantial tax increases on the 1% to fully fund the needs of the 99% such as job creation, education and social services.

2. End the wars and redirect military spending to social programs.

3. Real democracy that allows the voices of the 99% to heard and acted upon.

4. An end to the assault of the top 1% on workers' rights and repeal of all anti-union laws.

5. The end of institutionalized racism, sexism, homophobia and attacks on immigrants.

6. Protection of the environment, a sustainable economy and an end to reckless pollution in order to preserve the planet for future generations.

6. Protection of the environment, a sustainable economy and an end to reckless pollution in order to preserve the planet for future generations.

I'd like to see this statement of purpose expanded to include language specific to &quot;enforcement of the endangered species act in acknowledgement of the 6th great mass extinction event now accelerating&quot;
====re: Statement of purpose draft====
::[[user:sharksocks]] Oct 17, 2011 11:36 am
I understand the need to draft this sort of document but I think a statement of purpose needs to be a values statement. These read as very general demands. There is some values language within the demands, but we're better off articulating really clear demands as part of a unified &quot;occupied&quot; movement -- after we have a leadership body and clear voting structure. When people ask, &quot;what do you want?&quot; we should answer the question, &quot;what kind of country do you want?&quot;

No need to rush to demands. Let's be inclusive and tap into the anger and frustration of the 99%. 

I support the spirit behind this initiative, but I think we should table it, and focus our energy in bringing more people into the fold and working with other occupied movements to build a organization.
====re: Statement of purpose draft====
::[[user:DavidKeil]] Oct 17, 2011 12:17 pm
I accept that a statement of values or general goals is more realistic than a full program or set of demands or proposals.

It is necessary to state values, goals, or purposes, however, in order to expand the movement and win new people to it. When people join to support a movement, they want to know its goals. The news media wants to know its goals. This is legitimate and inevitable. Goals and expansion are not against each other; they go together.

Despite 25whatever's trolling, I'd like to point out the following:

Explicitly espousing tax policies implies a reliance on government force to achieve our goals. Don't forget that the government took (and destroyed) occupiers' property on Tues, October 11th by force. I think we need tax policy that is more fair, simpler and more transparent. Realistically the 1% who don't pay taxes now will clearly have to pay a fair share because everyone should. A progressive flat tax maybe?

Make 5: The end of institutionalized racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and oppression of all peoples.

6 should say something about a steady-state economy and economic metrics that favor biodiversity and a clean environment. We need an environmental policy wonk thread.

And 25whatever, I will block on any anti-2A proposal at any meeting I am in. You &lt;3 the bill of rights or you don't.

Look at this to find the approximate levels of support for your proposals.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2b1NawJhhmdXBOm9RySsZRcAIOcl4jhhMBV--CiIwU/edit?hl=en_US

The higher the ratio, the more support. (Example: A ratio of 20 means that for every 20 people who would support the issue, 1 would not.)

My suggestions:

3. should be amended to include the end of corporate person-hood and the removal of the revolving doors in politics (Very high support levels).

7. Bank reforms that reinstate the Glass-Steagall regulations, banning the use of commercial banking money for investment. New regulations are to be created that hold bank executives accountable if they defraud their investors, both in civil court and criminal court. (Both suggestions have very high support levels and are necessary to prevent the next huge banking crash.)

Dear 99% - 

I am extremely proud to stand with you all in this movement. We have the potential to be the greatest force for justice and freedom the world has ever seen. I have been waiting my adult life for this conversation to begin and I am thrilled at its success thus far.

Please let us not delve so eagerly into the ridiculous distraction that is our current political system. &quot;The System&quot; has amazing inertia that cannot be shifted with the levers we have available to us. We need to co-create our own system. Last night the Worcester Police Department asked the protesters to leave by 10 at their own GA. They recognized the legitimacy of our process, at least in some small way.

The moment we advocate tax policy, we are implying a reliance on the coercive force of the government. Not paying taxes would be a great way to protest the wars. Guess what? The IRS has shot guns and they will take your money and it will be spent on the war. The way taxes work is problematic - let's talk about that before we start demanding they be used in a certain way.

I believe solutions are premature. If we are working to come up with solutions to satisfy the demands of the media, I say let them wait: http://radlife.org/radlife/?p=109

We need an explicit agreement on the PROBLEMS before we start crafting solutions. THAT would get some attention. It is also something we might be able to come up with by winter.

it's impossible to tackle problems with education, health care, financial reform, or anything else until we get the money out of politics.  we have pressing problems, and we can't address them until we have an effective method of coming to democratic consensus.  

these policies might be a good first step:


1) #1) Use instant-runoff voting with a paper trail.

http://www.instantrunoff.com/why-use-irv

The two-party system has weakened our nation, as our founders predicted it would.

#2) Minimum boundary districting.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#Minimum_isoperimetric_quotient

Voters choose their representatives, not vice versa.

#3) Require that all elected officials disclose all income and all assets, as well as all contributions and all contributors. Income, assets, or contributions not declared shall be forfeited. Any official intentionally hiding income, assets, or contributions shall void her or his office.

and #4) Pass an amendment to the Constitution:

“Corporations are not people. They are property. As such, they have no rights. They have no right to free speech, nor any right to participate in the electoral process. Those rights belong to the American people.&quot;

Start at the source.  It would also be something that people could do from home, so they didn't all have to make it down to Dewey Park every day.  They could get petitions signed to get these proposals on the ballot.

yeah, i thought election reform was super reform, as the other reforms would happen easier once electoral reform happens.  and it was the raison d'etre of the original adbusters campaign.

i actually thought about setting up booths or street teams that were not obviously occupy-affiliated, seeming all scientific and whatnot.  most people would like it (from my tea party friends to greenies to libertarians, everyone seems to like them).  then ask for their signature, try to get them to call their officials, etc.  i'm sure some officials would be on board from the beginning.

So!  I have an idea for what our demand could be.  I think this demand would both call national attention to the dysfunction of a system that gives corporations the same rights as individuals and it would also popularize the idea of the people's mic and direct democracy... and who knows... maybe we'd get elected... So here it goes. I think our big demand should be worded as such! ...

&quot;If corporations are people then so too are social movements!  Therefore!  We the 99% nominate the peoples' mic for president in 2012!  Let the people occupy the executive branch! Regime change now!&quot;

I'm serious! thoughts?

==Goals==
:[[user:OccupyReality]] Oct 16, 2011 3:07 am
My first observation is that to accomplish anything, this movement will need to appeal to our democratic system to effect political change.  That means it needs to have *widespread support* for it's aims in our society, not just students and not just people on the far left or far right.  You need to appeal to the &quot;big middle&quot; of society, so you better be in touch with that.

It also means that you need some kind of well formulated set of actionable goals.  The mission has to be coherent, understandable and easily communicated, realistic in scope, and with broad democratic appeal.  This implies a mission that is focused on a handful at best of desired changes that all have a single theme, that must appeal to the &quot;big middle&quot;.  Given where the country is today, I think that means a small set of economic and financial reforms.

For example:
1. Reforming the tax system to simplify it, eliminating all the unfair/complex loopholes and exemptions, but retaining the progressive nature
2. Enacting regulations similar to Dodd-Frank, to avoid excessive risk taking by financial firms.
3. Rolling back the Supreme Court ruling allowing corporations to spend unlimited money on political campaigns (Citizens United)
4. Ending US involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, saving hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives


Big mistakes are: asking for radical change, like ending Capitalism; asking for everything you can think of as some endless wish list - save the whales, etc...
====re: Goals====

You should try to post this there, it's a more active discussion...they just changed the name to the reforms page.

Occupy Boston Ruins Food Bank Fundraiser, Conservatives Step in With $3,700 Fund Drive

October 15, 2011

-By Warner Todd Huston

The Greater Boston Food Bank intended to have a fundraising event in Boston’s Dewey Square over the weekend of the 14th of October. It was to be called the “Greenway Mobile Food Fest” and was supposed to help raise funds to feed the poor and needy. But due to the tantrums being thrown by the Occupy Boston protestors the event had to be canceled.

Despite the selfishness of these pointless, clueless protesters, though, conservative bloggers stepped in and raised over $3,000 for the food bank. An important question is, where is the media on this story? Isn’t this a perfect sort of human-interest story that media types usually love?

The media should love this. It’s got clueless, uninformed, cretins hurting an organization that helps feed the needy. It has a more caring group rising to the challenge to help replace those lost donations. Perfect story, right?

Ah, except that it is conservatives in the role of good guy and the Old Media can’t have that, now can they?

Now, the anti-capitalists of the so-called “Occupy” events pretend that they are for the downtrodden, the low man on the totem pole. But in Boston the Occupy-Whatevers were more interested in their tantrums than in actually helping anyone. So, the food bank and the small-business festival associated with it lost out to those selfish whiners that claim to be for “the little man.” Nice, eh?

Conservatives to the rescue

Once Brandon Kiser of The Right Sphere found out about the loss the food bank was about to suffer at the hands of the Occupy-Whatevers, he sprang into action asking his readers and friends to donate to the food bank to help it make up at least some of the donations it was going to lose because of the protest.
Kiser was shocked and gratified when his efforts and those of his conservative friends raised $3,700 for the food bank. And more will be raised as Kiser turned the donating over straight to the Greater Boston Food Bank.

So, at least the food bank didn’t lose everything. And isn’t it wonderful to see some real action during these protests for a change? Too bad nothing worthy is coming from the Occupy-Whatevers.

Sadly, it isn’t just the food bank that is losing out. The taxpayers are also in the hole thanks to these people.

On top the food banks loss, the city of Boston says that it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to repair the public space infested by the protests and to pay for the overtime of government employees like Police and maintenance workers. A city already strapped for cash is going to be in even worse shape thanks to these clueless people.

I suppose it isn’t surprising that conservatives rose to this challenge in Boston. After all, we all know that conservatives donate more to charity anyway, don’t we?

Of course, you too can donate to help show these leftists that conservatives don’t just gather to whine and destroy public parks. We actually do worthy things to help our fellow man. You can donate to the Greater Boston Food Bank using this link: https://my.gbfb.org/donate.

Ignore this. There will be many attempts to paint OWS as a net negative to society. We should address them internally and make sure we are contributing to a better society even as we protest for change -- but we should ignore blatant propaganda like this. 

What were the results of our own food drive?

&quot;Ignore this. There will be many attempts to paint OWS as a net negative to society.&quot;

1-Nowhere in the text did they mention OWS. Start reading for a change. They are talking to you, Occupy Boston. Don't try to turn this to wall street and run away from your responsibilities. Stop miss leading people! PLEASE....!

&quot;We should address them internally and make sure we are contributing to a better society even as we protest for change&quot;

2- Now that's a new one!!! So when you guys mess up, just like the government that you are harassing you get the privilege to only talk about it in closed spaces without &quot;RISKING TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THOSE WHO HAD TO SUFFER FROM YOUR MESS&quot;

&quot;but we should ignore blatant propaganda like this&quot;

3- Again, just like the people you call unfair in their process, you decide to pronounce this a &quot;propaganda&quot;. Is there any way you could really stop your SCAM of wanting change. Right now, I find you much more a tyrant soul than those you fight.

No need to talk about a &quot;food drive&quot; where I had to comment the bad hygiene techniques to one of your servers who clearly did not take it well since he was just another one being mislead. Can I blame him? I guess not...

My comments are based on what I see and hear inside your camp. Not from behind a TV set. Remember this.

Occupy Boston has been feeding the homeless members of the movement every day just like we feed everyone else, not giving some minor charity contributions while indulging our own pleasures.

That said, I think it is great that we've raised more money than the food festival was going to raise just by pissing off conservatives: everyone benefits but them.  The food bank gets more money than they'd get otherwise, the homeless members of Occupy Boston are still valuable community members and get tasty food, and the park is used for political protest and the betterment of the nation.  What's not to like?

It is not about liberal vs conservative, it is not about a two party system.  It is about the government representing the people who elected them.  It is about corporations not being people.

Why does the Boston Food Bank exist?  Lets think about dealing with the real problem, people don't have jobs so they can't afford to buy enough food.

So, Mr. LiberateBoston, if you are what your name portends then why are you playing a childish game of tit for tat with a movement that just began a month ago, with the greater intent to liberate humanity? Do you feel threatened? Are the people of Occupy Boston stealing your thunder by building a grass roots movement that is MUCH LARGER than yours? Are your feelings hurt? I can't believe your arguing about who gives more! And the Occupy movement is NOT an anti-capitalist movement, it's an anti-corprotocracy movement that is TRYING to re-establish DEMOCRACY and individual rights! Your argument is pathetic and reeks of insecurity. Maybe that's why you're trolling the grounds of the movement to nit pick and find things wrong about it instead of lending a hand, Mr. Liberator! Grow up man!

The person who wrote this also demonstrates an utter lack of a social critique.

There are so many discussions around pointed 'Statements of Purpose' (SOP) and lengthy 'Declarations of Occupation' (DOP), but we have not posted a simple 'Who We Are' - at least not that I can see.

Here is the one from NH -
http://occupynh.org/who-we-are/

As for the SOP and the DOP, it is very unfortunate that Occupy Wall Street does not take this one very basic leadership stance to just develop a brief and very broad statement of purpose, and disseminate to ALL Occupy Movements since we are in this together and are all asking for the same thing - to end the influence of money and special interests in Washington.

3) Banks are pressuring Democrats over their support of &quot;Occupy Wall Street,&quot; report Robin Bravender and Anna Palmer: &quot;After the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a recent email urging supporters to sign a petition backing the wave of Occupy Wall Street protests, phones at the party committee started ringing. Banking executives personally called the offices of DCCC Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) and DCCC Finance Chairman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) last week demanding answers, three financial services lobbyists told POLITICO. 'They were livid,' said one Democratic lobbyist with banking clients. The execs asked the lawmakers: 'What are you doing? Do you even understand some of the things that they’ve called for?' said another lobbyist with financial services clients who is a former Democratic Senate aide.&quot;

::[[user:

And a couple others from the same post:

2) We need to better regulate &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; banks, writes John Huntsman: &quot;More than three years after the crisis and the accompanying bailouts, the six largest American financial institutions are significantly bigger than they were before the crisis, having been encouraged to snap up Bear Stearns and other competitors at bargain prices. These banks now have assets worth over 66% of gross domestic product--at least $9.4 trillion, up from 20% of GDP in the 1990s. There is no evidence that institutions of this size add sufficient value to offset the systemic risk they pose. The major banks' too-big-to-fail status gives them a comparative advantage in borrowing over their competitors thanks to the federal bailout backstop. This funding subsidy amounts to roughly 50 basis points, or one-half of a percentage point in today's market.&quot;

3) The falling share of labor in the economy is driving public discontent, writes Peter Orszag: &quot;In Economics 101, students learn that the share of national income received by labor stays roughly constant with the share received by capital. This is the first of 'Kaldor’s stylized facts,' articulated half a century ago by the Cambridge economist Nicholas Kaldor. Recent experience betrays this lesson. Over the past two decades -- and especially since about 2000 -- the share of national income that flows into wages and other kinds of worker compensation has been plummeting in various countries. Labor share normally bounces around over the business cycle, but given how long the decline has lasted, it can’t be dismissed as cyclical. And this partly explains the kind of anger and frustration that is fueling the Occupy Wall Street movement worldwide.&quot;

==Bank of America -- Direct Action==
:[[user:wooriginal]] Oct 7, 2011 9:19 am
We're organizing a direct action against Bank of America.  

WHAT WE WANT TO DO

March down to BOA headquarters with the full protest march behind us
Close our accounts one by one as the protest goes on outside BOA headquarters
Keep a running tally of how much money we pulled out of BOA
Publicize the event to Media to try to turn it into a feature of all the national marches.
WHY
Because Bank of America is too big, holding nearly $2.3 trillion in assets (18% of GDP).
Because it is our money, and we can move it to local institutions that won't take enormous risks that jeopardize the economy.
Because it is a direct action that will resonate across the country and will help continue to draw attention and supporters to the Occupy movement.
WHAT TO DO

If you are a BOA customer and are interested in joining us, please send me a message (click on my username). 

No date has been set for the action. Right now, we're just building support and starting to organize.

This is a great idea! I'm definitely interested in participating, as I've been planning to leave Bank of America for a very long time. From a practical perspective, I think this action needs to be planned at least a week ahead of time, because closing a bank account requires making sure that you have no pending charges in your account. This means that someone interested in taking part would need to stop charging things on their debit/credit card for at least a few days so that all charges can go through and you can close your account outright. I'd also suggest we put together a list of local banks that people could go use as an alternative to B of A.

7 Simple Steps To Move Your Checking Account

*1. Open Your New Account*

In most cases, you should be able open a checking account with an initial deposit of $25 to $100. At a credit union, you’ll also become a member and co-owner at the same time.

*2. Order New Checks and an ATM/Debit Card*

These typically arrive within 1 to 2 weeks. You should also consider applying for a credit card from your new local bank or credit union at the same time.

*3. Ask Your Employer to Reroute Your Direct Deposit*

When you open your new account, ask the bank or credit union for a direct deposit authorization form that includes your new account information. Give this form to your employer and anyone else who makes direct deposits to your account. It may take one or more pay cycles for the change to be made, so keep your old checking account open and watch for the switch.

*4. Contact Companies that Direct-Debit Your Account*

Using your last bank statement, make a list of any businesses that you’ve authorized to directly debit your account. Ask your new bank or credit union for an automatic payments authorization form that includes your new account information. Send this to the businesses on your list.

*5. Set-up Online Bill Paying for Your New Account*

If you like to pay bills online, set up bill payment information for your new account. Also, stop any automatic, recurring payments you have established through your old account.

*6. Close Your Old Account*

Once you have started receiving direct deposits into your new account and are sure that there are no outstanding checks or automatic debits that need to clear, close your old account. Warning: do not just withdraw the last dollar and assume the account will fade away on its own. Your old big bank may start charging you fees for having an empty or inactive checking account. Instead, follow the bank’s procedure for closing out the account.

Whether you decide to take a direct action as a group or not I would urge all those involved to look into moving their money from the major banks. 

Credit Unions are a fantastic alternative as they are owned by the depositors in the bank rather than shareholders. 

You can find a credit union in your area by going to the CSCU which lists Credit Unions nationwide.

Definite opportunity that we could demonstrate around. I think the messaging around any demonstration should be around holding wall st accountable, putting people over profits, bailing out the public and not the banks, and other highly populist messages like that. &quot;End the Fed&quot; and other complex and esoteric messages are extremely hard to relate to, and are more ideologies than solutions. It's hard for me to relate to messages around end the fed, or even imagine what that actually means. I think most people don't even understand what the fuck the fed does--included many people in the occupy movement. 

I don't mean to &quot;dumb down&quot; the movement and welcome any pushback.

==Boycott banks with predatory lending practices==
:[[user:Stewart76]] Oct 15, 2011 10:52 pm
A while back someone suggested organizing a protests against bofa in response to their new fees...not sure what happened with that, but I that was a good place to start.  Stop giving them our money.

==about &quot;Message&quot;==

Don't walk away :) they need you.

I agree with you to &quot; limit ourselves to a mission of building a way for the 99% to end the oppression of the monied elite&quot;.

No detailed demands, but one singular one to end the influence of money on our politics.

Can you please send a message to the GA since I can't participate in person (but I have been monitoring the blogs off the home page daily) - and most supporters think the same. I suggested the following as a DRAFT:



STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

OWS/OB &amp; ALL Movements around the USA

“This is a non-partisan movement. We want to end corporate and financial influence on our government. Corporations should not have more of a voice and more rights than the American people. We demand greater accountability on Wall Street and greater responsiveness in Washington. We demand REAL change. We stand in solidarity with all the movements around the world protesting against corporate greed. 

Let the voice of the 99% be heard!”

OK, will do.  Agree with that you say.  I'm just trying to facilitate a lot of different groups all moving in different directions.  Like herding squirrels. They have so much in commen.  If we were being paid, I'd rent a big hotel and feed them a lot, and they'd agree in no time.

==Protect the Commons. Affordability. Demand Accountability.==
:[[user:qandnotq]] Wednesday, 10:28 am
I am proposing that we can organize all of our demands into the framework of Commons, Affordability, and Accountability.

Protecting the Commons includes government access, environmental preservation and improvements, infrastructure and internets, the Marketplace, and so on...

Affordability is the demand that Government Access (Courts), Loans (Education and Mortgages...), and Health Services and Cost of Living must stay Affordable if our country is to thrive. (This doesn't mean it has to be easy. Just possible, which it currently isn't for many people.)

Accountability is straighforward, but demands transparency and action on profiteering in economic times like these. It is broadly anti-corruption as well. I like the term Accountability better than Transparency since it's more about action than access.

Feel free to debate this, or to start aligning our interests under these banners.

-Tank-

I agree. I will help, but feel that anyone can try to shape it into a strong, concise message. I almost feel that brainstorming on it is going to do wonders. I will move my discussion to the link you have.

==Workers should be given seats on the boards of directors==
:[[user:gwiech]] Oct 18, 2011 12:51 pm
The board can increasingly be a forum for industrial relations and shop-floor issues, on which worker directors can give expert opinions, and made management more cautious about employee-sensitive issues such as layoffs and plant closures. Worker representation can also increase the flow of information among the board, unions, and employees, helping both management and labor better understand each other and reduce conflicts.
Employee representation tends to be more effective in cases where the worker directors are directly elected by the workers and accepted as legitimate participants on the board.

====re: no more room====
::[[user:yanikn]] Oct 6, 2011 8:55 am
I meant occupying.

And then I know there are permits needed to run a generator. Permits that probably wouldn't be granted and then would become an excuse to shut down the occupation.

is it possible to send a group to the mayor to plead the case? perhaps with some prominent boston personalities, from the globe perhaps.. or from the union group...

just a thought.

cause from what i am hearing, moving on down the line is the path that will cause a clamp down
====re: no more room====
::[[user:jobelenus]] Oct 6, 2011 9:07 pm
i really like the though of boston common... the backside (beacon/charles) is used by groups often... but the front on tremont is usually wide open. I imagine they'd have a hard time kicking you off - both are owned by the city, and the city hasn't had a problem yet.

Though, with some research the common does technically have a curfew: http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/08/30/curfew_targets_crime_on_common/

I've not heard anything recent about that...

have you guys thought about gov't center? granted it isn't a park - its pavement. but it is 1) directly in front of city hall, 2) really large, 3) foot traffic is greater there.

downsides; 1) it is actually used semi-often by groups/causes so space-conflicts could be a problem. 2) find a new way to stake/lockdown tents

i'll continue to try to think of other places as well.

I have to admit that I was moved watching Jamarhl http://blackstonian.com/news/2011/10/jamarhl-crawford-addresses-occupy-boston-1012/

If we cannot expand across the street along the greenway - is there anything preventing us from going into Roxbury? If we truly want to make this diverse and listen to them we should be there. And we should be there, not to have them join us - but as he said, for us to join them. Not to solve their problems, but to listen to their problems.

what about the Charles River reservation, all the land along the Charles river. It is a state park, and since the Gov came to visit Dewey Square, maybe he'd not clamp down. If there is a clamp down, the state police have jurisdiction, but can always bring in Boston police. Just a thought.

==Poles==

Make a post here with what experience/interest you have. Lets put together a list of folks interested in covering Occupy Boston. 

A few goals could would be to improve quality of low light capture at evening events like GA's. Have commentators broadcast to live stream when there is a break in coverage.

Enable teams to livestream on the move ( at marches ). 

Set up a repository to collect and distribute media shot at event. 

If there is somebody already working on this let us know their name and we can rally behind them.

Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation

The times in which we live confront us with a combination of crises the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, economic, social, and environmental messes that demands a radical clean-up. While each of these crises has its own determinants, they also share a common root cause: the domination of our social, economic, and political order by a system designed to serve a wealthy elite, at the expense of the vast majority of the population here and around the world, not to mention other living creatures on this planet. In light of these interlocking crises, which threaten our lives, our livelihoods, our liberty, our human values, and our common future, We, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, believe that &quot;business as usual&quot; is no longer an option. The corrupt order and the intolerable crises amidst which we live demand a profound, collective response, a popular and participatory response of the sort the ruling elite can neither allow, nor even imagine:

Whereas, the problems of economic inequality, unemployment, and crushing debt, not to mention corporate greed and unaccountability, are all symptomatic of the larger corrupting influence money has on our political and social lives,

Whereas, this influence has consistently been used to impede progress toward a more just and sustainable society, and has often perpetuated crisis and war at home and abroad in furtherance of its own undemocratic agenda,

Whereas, the pursuit of this agenda has had profoundly detrimental effects on all working and middle class communities - and particularly on communities of color, youth, and other marginalized segments of our population – as well as on the environmental systems upon which our species depends,

Whereas, those pursuing this agenda also own and control the media we require to inform ourselves of their many abuses of money and power,

And whereas, our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan our resistance,

Be it resolved that we, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, acting in solidarity with occupations across America and with peoples' movements worldwide, do hereby declare our opposition to all systems of power that function to maintain these oppressive and undemocratic arrangements, just as we declare our affirmation in the belief that a better world is possible, and that it is our right and responsibility to begin creating it.

I think it's more important to help clarify where the movement is going than it is what it is reacting to; whether that clarification/vision/identity results in &quot;demands&quot; or a road map or not, it's still an important discussion to have.

It is a discussion we should be having every day, you're absolutely right. But it is not something that I feel belongs in an declaration of occupation. As I said in another thread in response to your very same argument: 

This is a declaration of occupation, which is intended to outline general grievances and a path toward a participatory response, ie our occupations, GA's, and popular movements.

It is NOT intended to present demands. If it is your vision to write a declaration that also includes demands, that is your prerogative and I highly anticipate seeing it and the discussion it sparks. However, I know for a fact that it will not pass GA, as there are many people involved in this movement that do not want to see demands put forth at this time.

My personal intention in writing this was to get something together that I thought WOULD pass GA: a declaration in support of the principals of democracy and social justice that we COULD all agree on, something that will go a long way toward offering up a more cohesive identity for this movement and perhaps lend itself toward figuring out &quot;where this movement is going,&quot; as you say.

just jumping in - &quot;the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before&quot; can be said of anything that happens from this moment on. Maybe just acknowledgement of this as a time of crisis is enough. 
I'm also wondering how &quot;radical clean-up&quot; will be translated.  The more idioms can be avoided the better, imho 
and... &quot;a popular and participatory response of the sort the ruling elite can neither allow, nor even imagine&quot;. that's more than a little melodramatic and paranoid-sounding. The changes in the ability of the population to participate might be worth highlighting, but the &quot;ruling elite&quot; talk is bit much

I hope to have more constructive things to add going forward, just felt compelled to get that out.  Thanks to all who have already spent time crafting this and building something pretty amazing down at Dewey Sq.

10/16, 10:55 pm. In response to totaltrash's suggestions above, as well at to pcovery's in another thread, there are two changes in the introduction paragraph: one subtle one in word choice, and one more drastic one in the final sentence. I don't know if I'm 100% on that last one, but I wanted to give it a shot and see how it went by ya'll, because I do recognize the validity of the concern over how it was phrased. But the question now is, is this actually an improvement?:

The times in which we live confront us with a combination of crises the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, social, and environmental messes that demands an immediate clean-up. While each of these crises has its own determinants, they also all share a common root cause: the domination of our social, economic, and political order by the interests of a wealthy elite, at the expense of the vast majority of the population here and around the world, not to mention other living creatures on this planet. In light of these interlocking crises, which threaten our lives, our livelihoods, our liberty, our human values, and our common future, We, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, believe that &quot;business as usual&quot; is no longer an option. The corrupt order and the intolerable crises amidst which we live demand a profound, collective response, a popular and participatory response that's unrelenting in its application of the weathered refrain, with liberty and justice for all.

Whereas, the problems of economic inequality, unemployment, and crushing debt, not to mention corporate greed and unaccountability, are all symptomatic of the larger corrupting influence money has on our political and social lives,

Whereas, this influence has consistently been used to impede progress toward a more just and sustainable society, and has often perpetuated crisis and war at home and abroad in furtherance of its own undemocratic agenda,

Whereas, the pursuit of this agenda has had profoundly detrimental effects on all working and middle class communities - and particularly on communities of color, youth, and other marginalized segments of our population – as well as on the environmental systems upon which our species depends,

Whereas, those pursuing this agenda also own or control, directly or indirectly, the media and legal apparatus which we require to stay informed of, and attempt to rectify, their many abuses of power,

And whereas, our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan our resistance,

Be it resolved that we, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, acting in solidarity with occupations across America and with peoples' movements worldwide, do hereby declare our opposition to all systems of power that function to maintain these oppressive and undemocratic arrangements, just as we declare our affirmation in the belief that a better world is possible, and that it is our right and responsibility to begin creating it.

Edited, Statement of Occupation

Today the United States is confronted by a toxic mix of financial, social, and environmental catastrophes that demand a thorough and immediate clean-up. The common root of this disaster is the domination of our social, economic, and political lives by the interests of the wealthy elite. Because the actions of the elite threaten our lives, the lives of all the Earth’s creatures, our livelihoods, our liberty, our human values, and our common future, We, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston have abandoned the usual channels of democratic action. The corrupt order amidst which we live demands a profound, collective response. Occupy Boston is that response.

Because, the problems of economic inequality, unemployment, and crushing debt, are all symptomatic of the larger corrupting influence money has on our political and social lives,

Because, this influence impedes progress toward a more just and sustainable society, perpetuates crisis and war at home and perverts democratic action,

Because, the pursuit of this agenda has an even more devastating effect on the more vulnerable and less empowered members of our community as well as on the ecosystems upon which our species depends,

Because, those pursuing this agenda also own or control, directly or indirectly, the media and legal apparatus: 

We have retaken the commons and resurrected democracy.

Be it resolved that we, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, acting in solidarity with occupations across America and with peoples' movements worldwide, do hereby declare our opposition to all systems of power that function to maintain oppressive and undemocratic systems. We declare that a better world is possible, and that it is our right and responsibility to begin creating it.


The mission of OB is to give birth to a just and compassionate body politic that treads lightly upon the Earth.

Our mission will be accomplished when these goals are met:
1. The US has a sustainable peace time economy.
2. The voices of the 99% are heard and acted upon.
3. The Earth’s rights are recognized as being on par with human beings.
4. In allocating resources, the US government priorities the needs of the 99% who are not wealthy.

Oh, and just a suggestion. Have someone who is involved in Marketing craft a simple and succint message. The above are just too many words to say the same thing different ways. You are going to cause words to be ripped apart and over-analyzed resulting in the MAIN MESSAGE being diluted, a very real danger to the movement. Messages communicated the wrong way can be divisive and can cause you to lose supporters and we can't afford that. SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE and to the POINT...that's what I would recommend. Trim the fat off of this, state facts not ideological concepts. Yes, I want what's good for the &quot;World&quot; and for the &quot;Earth&quot; to be protected, but the fact of the matter is that your AUDIENCE is: the AMERICAN working and middle class Americans. This is who you are talking to and seeking support from.

Say the simple message is to &quot;End the influence of money, corporations and special interests on politics&quot; -

Then at the end state - &quot;We stand in solidarity with all democracies around the world who encounter the same challenge - their 99% not being heard&quot;

Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;. I think you can tell I am passionate about a simple and succint message. It has more of a chance to be successful and less chance of being ripped apart.

OWS/OB &amp; ALL Movements around the USA

&quot;This is a non-partisan movement. We want to end corporate and financial influence on our government. Corporations should not have more of a voice and more rights than the American people.

I do think it needs to be short...sorry. I like everything that is about the economy because that's what will draw most people. I would take out what is about the 'Earth' because although I too am for protecting the environment, I think it sounds too idealistic and may not appeal to a broad audience.

Hi,

I've been trying to convince the Ideas Working Group to set up a process parallel to theirs that would allow Individual Message Proposals (that conform to a consistent format) to be considered along side their Camel*. I'm not getting very far. Maybe a few more voices? 

The basic idea would be to circulate/make available a form with slots for Mission, Goals, etc. with word limits, and allow individuals to fill in (all or some) of the  blanks,and to make the resulting Message Proposals, written by individuals, not committtees, available to the whole community. 

Honestly, I don't know if this falls w/in the the purview of the Ideas Proposal that was approved by GA, but I think it's a good one since it does actually allow real voices to be heard. 

Thoughts? Anyone want to take it on?

- POSITIVE FEEDBACK - 
Thank you to the OccupyBoston organizers!

I like what OccupyBoston has posted on the General FAQ page http://www.occupyboston.org/faq/general-faq/
as guidance to all supporters of this non-partisan movement - to communicate why most people regardless which party they vote for support this movement:

&quot;What are you protesting?
Most people who support Occupy Boston call for reforming Wall Street and removing special interest from government, but there no one single issue or demand that summarizes our movement. People are dissatisfied with how our country is being run and want fundamental, lasting change of many kinds.&quot;

Very nice OccupyBoston - thank you for communicating this!

Aria, I don't think a lengthy process as described above is needed for a Mission statement. We know what we want and we have to communicate it short and to the point for Statement of Purpose or Mission Statement.

What you proposed may be a good idea for an online forum for Goals, BUT it must it must be a content management mechanism that has ONE stream though (not a bunch of disjointed forums as we have on the Wiki). Without that it is very hard to collaborate, refine content and have an iterative process for improving language on Goals (and do like Goals better than Demands...)

==&quot;plan our resistance&quot; --&gt;==
:[[user:Sage.Rad]] Yesterday 5:58 am
A quick point. Instead of &quot;plan our resistance&quot; i suggest &quot;discuss alternatives&quot; or &quot;envision alternatives&quot;. I think it's baiting the authorities and alienating some of the public who may be sympathetic to say &quot;plan our resistance&quot; for reasons that seem obvious to me.

==I&#039;m not sure if this qualifies as a Statement of Purpose as ya&#039;ll are envisioning it.==
:[[user:JSkeet]] Oct 16, 2011 12:25 pm
Or at least, I'm unsure if the statement of purpose that is intended to come out of this wiki process will just be a declaration of occupation, as this proposal is, or if it will propose specific remedies or demands as well. 

In fact I'm even unclear about whether or not it is possible to have several SOPs coming out of this process - for instance one that does what this proposal attempts to do, and others that attempt to outline remedies, demands, etc - or if the goal is to formulate everything into one document.

If that is the envisioned process, I am strongly and principally opposed to it. Regardless of where I stand on the idea of making demands at this point in time (hint: I'm ambivalent, but generally in favor of it), I will not waste time in contributing to a document that will include demands, because I do not believe that it will pass GA. Instead of putting all our eggs in one basket, I'd prefer if we passed a document like this first, as its lack of demands or particular remedies is in perfect keeping with what I perceive to be the objectives of a declaration of occupation - that is, a document that expresses grievances, and proposes the beginning of a process toward rectifying them (our occupation movement!). Attaching demands to such a document, while perhaps feasible in other contexts, would in fact hinder our ability to pass anything of this sort. My opinion is that after over 2 weeks of occupying, we're due for something soon, and, as the consensus model reminds us, it's &quot;Is this a proposal you could live with,&quot; not &quot;Is this the very best thing we can come up with ever?&quot;

::[[user:anonymous-observer]] Thursday, 7:03 pm
JSkeet - please don't overthink it. 

SIMPLICITY
It doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be simple to appeal to a broad base, to draw a lot of people towards the movement.

GENERAL BROAD MESSAGE
There should NOT be a list of demands. There should be on singular demand that Washington will fix the mess we are in. 

DON'T REINVENT THE WHEEL
Here is what was on the OB home page at one point (Saturday Marches Post): OccupyBoston demands (NOTE - one demand only...) 
Quote: &quot;greater accountability on Wall Street and greater responsiveness in Washington&quot;

KEY POINT
The most common THEME on the BLOGS from supporters is ending the influence of money/corporations/special interests on our politics. Here are examples to support this.

BLOGGER 1
Downsizing corporate influence over the political process would be my best suggestion for a starting point- it covers a lot of ground while being fairly focused at the same time. Fix the political process and you solve a lot of the issues with Wall Street. &quot;

BLOGGER 2
&quot;That’s a good point. It’s really difficult to create a message that appeals to all of OB, as I’ve seen at the GAs. But maybe ending corporate/financial influence in politics would be a good starting point, as part of our overall protest against the broken system that has gotten us to this point.&quot;

BLOGGER 3
&quot;What people want is the removal of the influence of money from government&quot;

BLOGGER 4
&quot;The removal of corporate influence, etc., is what drew me to the movement. Almost every thread on this site emphasizes everything but the main issue...&quot;

BLOGGER 5
&quot;...there seems to be a push by politicians and pundits for the Occupy movements to define specific policy changes but that would be a mistake. In my opinion, that would be painting the movements into a corner. 
Look, PhD’s and Nobel Prize winners have been debating how to fix this mess since 2008 and there are still as many theories as there are economists. The politicians who ignored or mocked OWS last week are now asking for policy solutions? That’s like sobebody coming into your house, throwing your lamp on the floor and then demanding to know how you’re going to fix it! 
For a public statement of policy I’d suggest something like, “Washington, Wall Street and Corporate America all co-operated in driving the country into the swamp we find ourselves in today. We’re not going to take it anymore. We demand that you effect systemic changes to redress the economic disparities that exist in the United States today. You broke it, You fix it. We are watching closely.”

Hope this helps...

OWS/OB &amp; ALL Movements around the USA

&quot;This is a non-partisan movement. We want to end corporate and financial influence on our government. Corporations should not have more of a voice and more rights than the American people. We demand greater accountability on Wall Street and greater responsiveness in Washington. We demand REAL change.

==Statement of Purpose==
:[[user:Charlie-Boo]] Oct 16, 2011 1:39 am
The displayed SOP with the &quot;whereas&quot; and &quot;therefore&quot;s is using legal language.  We certainly don't want to copy the enemy.

1. All SOP should be about corporations causing unfairness and hardships among the people, or harming the country as a whole.  That is why we OCCUPY WALL STREET (symbolically.)

2. No flaming &quot;Fascist State&quot; rhetoric - that says nothing and just turns off people.

3. You need to first ask for SYMPTOMS.  Create a list of the effects of bad business behavior.

4. From the list of SYMPTOMS you develop a list of CAUSES.

5. From the list of CAUSES you develop a list of REMEDIES of the CAUSES.

6. You propose the remedies be put into law.

When and where do we show up to participate in a real brain-storming session?  That is the onlY way you can develop your ideas - Oorganize, in person, interactively and analytically.  I have developed computer systems for decades and I can show you how ideas are created and formalized - starting with the outline above.

====re: Statement of Purpose====

Hell All,


We cannot hope to successfully address critical problems such as Wall Street reform, environmental concerns, health care reform, jobs, etc. as long as OUR (not “the”) Federal Government remains exclusively responsive to the 1%.  

The SOP, therefore, ought to clearly and explicitly hold campaign finance reform [and/or a Constitutional  Amendment (such as Sen. Kerry's or Rep. Edwards - Maryland) to permanently patch the gaping hole left by the Citizen's United] as a prerequisite, and as preparatory to addressing the myriad aforementioned policy concerns of average Americans.    

We can plea for decades about housing, student loan debt, jobs, Wall Street reform, but until we cleanse our own governing process of heavy undue influence, we can be assured that NO ONE in D.C. will be listening.  

This primary purpose of creating a more open and responsive Federal Government should be placed at the absolute center of the SOP for three critically important reasons:

1)It is something that Democrats, Conservatives, Libertarians, Socialists, and most others can agree upon.  The movement will be killed (and ignored) if it is simply a list of demands from the left that plays like a broken record.  The SOP needs to clearly invite all political views for a fair competition of ideas, and needs to fight for the same in DC.   This ought to be an American Movement,  not the Noam Chomsky, or Ron Paul Movement.  

2)It is a logical prerequisite to addressing ALL other concerns.   One must clear the wax out of government's ears before we expect it to be able to listen and respond.   

3)It is highly actionable.   An Amendment is already drafted, and floating behind the scenes of congress.   This is “shovel ready.”  If fighting the fight means marching out day in day out, across the country, collecting millions of signatures, one by one, pledging citizens to vote down members of Congress that fail to vote to send the  Amendment through Congress to the states, then THE FIGHT IS ON – starting immediately.  This is clear, actionable, and foundational to all other serious concerns.

    Thanks,  Brian M.

Charlie, I am in no way trying to accomplish the lofty vision you have put forth for what a SOP should be. As I have said verbatim elsewhere: This is merely a declaration of occupation. It is NOT intended to present demands. If it is your vision to write a declaration that also includes demands, that is your prerogative and I highly anticipate seeing it and the discussion it sparks. However, I know for a fact that it will not pass GA, as there are many people involved in this movement that do not want to see demands put forth at this time.

My personal intention in writing this was to get something together that I thought WOULD pass GA: a declaration in support of the principals of democracy and social justice that we COULD all agree on, something that will go a long way toward offering up a more cohesive identity for this movement and perhaps lend itself toward drafting a list of demands in the future. 

I would hate to see us wait another couple weeks trying to draft an SOP that accomplishes everything you want it to, only to see it shot down on the principled objection that it is presenting demands that not everyone agrees with. Let's start now, where we all agree, so we'll have something to point to while we try to hammer out the more ambitious position statements.

bm_inboston, I admire your commitment to that cause, and in another context I may be inclined to agree with you on its importance, but this document is not meant to put forth any actionable items besides &quot;Occupy!&quot; That is our number one actionable item IMO, and although it's coming two weeks after the fact, a declaration of occupation is supposed to be a statement supporting that action as a valuable and necessary tactic in the collective process of rectifying the grievances that brought us out to occupy in the first place.

:[[user:pcovery]] Oct 16, 2011 5:49 am
In addition to disliking the overall tone of manifesto, I disagree with these parts, strongly:

&quot;the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, economic, social, and environmental messes that demands a radical clean-up.&quot; The current situation in no way compares to the mess before the Civil War, or the Great Depression or even the uncertainty after the Revolution. Also, we are not in any way agreed on the need for &quot;radical&quot; anything. Similarly, this is overblown and will alienate a lot of us: &quot;'business as usual' is no longer an option. The corrupt order, and the intolerable crises amidst which we live demand a profound, collective response, a popular and participatory response of the sort the ruling elite can neither allow, nor even imagine.&quot;

&quot;system designed to serve a wealthy elite&quot; History shows there have been many interests and factors affecting our system. It is too simplistic to say it was designed to entirely suit one group.

&quot;those pursuing this agenda also own and control the media we require to inform ourselves&quot; This is outdated and irrelevant to your conclusion.

&quot;our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan our resistance&quot; Yet another controversial and unsupported claim. 

I think it's important to keep our feet firmly planted in present reality and to build slowly within the existing system. Great disturbance will, justly, have little support because history has shown it to be a breeding ground for tyrants.

::[[user:JSkeet]] Oct 16, 2011 11:40 am
Hey, I'm sorry for spamming the wiki with this proposal: when I wrote it there was no clear idea of where things like this should go, so I put it wherever I thought it would be relevant. A lot of valuable discussion was happening over at the SPP message board (http://occupyboston.wikispaces.com/message/view/Strategies%2C+Proposals%2C+Positions/44258450), some of which I'll respond to here in an attempt to bring the discussion to one place.

To pcovery: I'm willing to alter the intro to speak more to contemporary history instead of the entire US history. I'll post the revision when I come up with it. However, I disagree that we have not more or less agreed on the need for radical solutions to our current problems: how else would you explain the popularity of a movement that has, thus far, firmly planted itself outside of the established political process, and whose language - in the form of the solidarity statements we write, the declarations some of our movement has ratified, the chants that we yell, and the actions that we take - is indeed demanding a radical departure from business as usual. I mean, did you SEE the document we passed in support of the Oct 15th day of action? Does that sound like business as usual to you, or that we are not clear on wanting a sharp break with the status quo? I wrote this based on the spirit of the movement thus far, that's all. 

Also, I too believe that many factors and factions, not all of whom are wealthy, affect the society under which we live. I am not convinced, though, that our current economic and political system is fundamentally designed to cater to any of their interests over the interests of the wealthy, which is why I included that section.

The part on media may indeed be a weak point in the document. I'll consider revising, but keep in mind that I do not find it irrelevant to the conclusion at all, which is basically saying that it is only through a process like the one we have initiated with our movement - that is, a process outside the established and mediated channels of discussing political and economic theory and action - that we can begin the collective process of affecting the change we require. Again, I feel that the spirit on our movement is very representative of this idea. To be clear, though, I do not believe that our movement has a monopoly on the &quot;correct&quot; process for political and economic change - just that, if we were to rely solely upon established channels to be having these discussions, we wouldn't be having them at all!

As to the part referring to our assemblies, I believe it ties into my last point about the necessity for beginning these processes outside of established political channels, and I believe that if there is any lesson to be learned from the last year of political movements worldwide, it is that there is a widespread belief in just such a sentiment, as well as in the power of parallel democratic assemblies as a launching off point for sweeping change.

To Aria: This is a declaration of occupation, which is intended to outline general grievances and a path toward a participatory response, ie our occupations, GA's, and popular movements.

It is NOT intended to present demands. If it is your vision to write a declaration that also includes demands, that is your prerogative and I highly anticipate seeing it and the discussion it sparks. However, I know for a fact that it will not pass GA, as there are many people involved in this movement that do not want to see demands put forth at this time.

My personal intention in writing this was to get something together that I thought WOULD pass GA: a declaration in support of the principals of democracy and social justice that we COULD all agree on, something that will go a long way toward offering up a more cohesive identity for this movement and perhaps lend itself toward drafting a list of demands in the future.

To Charlie-Boo: We are all here because we are in general agreement that somehow, this system serves the few at the expense of the many. However, naming that system outright gets contentious and divisive: is it capitalism, is it the state, is the the fed, is it corporate influence in politics? This statement was meant to capture all of those sentiments and more in a way that was not divisive, and that rested upon a shared vision for a democratic and just society. Doing anything other than that is going to get whatever proposal you come up with rejected by the GA.

Actually pcovery, I just looked over your first objection and attempted to alter it to speak more of contemporary history when I realized that it's actually already doing that. &quot;We in the united states,&quot; implies those living here now. It is saying that this is the largest crises we've ever faced, and I believe that's true.

I continue to strongly disagree and I believe that going down the path of this kind of manifesto will disqualify Occupy Boston from claiming anything about the &quot;99%.&quot;  

Point by point:
&quot;We in the united states,&quot; may vaguely imply those living here now, but your claim still doesn't hold.  1963, 1968 and 1970 were all greater crises in my experience than the current situation.

Radical solutions are anathema to many, MANY people who have very good reasons to be highly suspicious of anyone claiming they are necessary.  It does no good to explain offline that by &quot;radical&quot; you just mean that something besides voting.  You are speaking to people who have seen the results of revolutions and the difficulty of building credibility for balanced systems.  Freaking out every time a system gets skewed is a road many people have seen lead to disaster.  Chanted slogans are fine to grab attention but they are far too naive and shallow to justify a position anywhere but on the margins.

When we talk of &quot;design&quot; of a system, I assume we're talking about the intentional framing of the U.S. government, amendments and legislation.  This system is not designed to screw people over.  It may have that inadvertent effect, but I protest claiming it is &quot;designed&quot; to be elitist.

You are indeed relying on established channels to have the current discussion.  You're relying on the city's infrastructure and working people's donations to support the occupation; on the media to make the occupation have any effect on popular opinion; on the corporate and governmental systems to maintain food, order and expectations for future viability, as well as to turn popular opinion into actions.  You are not nearly as revolutionary as you may imagine, thank goodness.  Don't alienate people with unnecessary affectations of crisis. 

I'm very supportive of OB, but I'm also very afraid of its spinning off into foolish rhetoric.  Please don't go there.

All radical as an adj means is, literally: Relating to or affecting the fundamental nature of something; far-reaching or thorough. A radical solution to a problem, then, is one that prioritizes addressing the forces that created the problem in the first place. If you do not feel like the problems we face need a response that is far-reaching and thorough, what, may I ask, is the appropriate response?

I'm actually in favor of amending the &quot;system designed to serve a wealthy elite,&quot; part, and replacing it with something like this: &quot;While each of these crises has its own determinants, they also all share a common root cause: the domination of our social, economic, and political order by the interests of a wealthy elite...&quot; This makes no claims about the original intent behind the designs of our political and economic systems, but still addresses the current reality of their subordination to the interests of wealth. Does that sound better?

I'm glad you feel that our movement exists within the procedural norms of our democratic process, and I think you're even correct in principle: we have a constitution that enshrines the rights of freedom of speech and assembly, and we are merely exercising those rights as an important part of the democratic process. This tangent was in relation to the whereas statement about media, though, and I'd like to keep on that point. 

It is, of course, a powerful statement, one that is reflecting an often subtle reality: that the range of discussion and debate in this country is limited by the practices of for-profit media, and that media is (and this time not so subtly) being increasingly concentrated into the hands of a wealthy few. This arrangement presents us with a major hurdle when it comes to addressing abuses of wealth and power, and so I included it in the declaration to help set up the question of &quot;why we occupy,&quot; which is addressed in the next whereas statement as well as the conclusion. 

Also, there's no need to be patronizing. You are not talking to an ideologue here, and I am not someone who harbors illusions about how &quot;revolutionary&quot; I am. Of course, I do have strong and (usually) well informed opinions on the state of our crisis, but this document is actually a lot less reflective of them as it is of the tactical compromise that is inherent in this movement. And what amazes me about our situation right now is that even at compromise, this movement is assured of itself enough to make strong statements and radical demands, and that it's having the exact opposite effect of the alienation you're anticipating.

Glad to hear you're not as much of an ideologue as you sound in the manifesto. Tell me you're also not naive enough to believe that &quot;radical&quot; in a political document means nothing more than &quot;far-reaching or thorough.&quot;

Delusional people can make powerful statements.  Whether the statement is true and useful interests me more.  I think you are dead wrong in what is drawing widespread support to the Occupy movements; I think it is the openness of the agenda and the opportunity to include many points of view, not the radical demands, that are helping the movement.  

Neither of us knows this clearly now in the moment, but I can tell you that I and pretty much everyone I know will back right away if the movement starts sounding like absolutist propaganda.  I don't want to see the Right given such juicy meat for their skewers, and I don't think I'll live long enough to see the light at the end of the next 4 decades of backlash that such proclamations will induce.

The manifesto does sound to me like handing ammunition to those opposed to Occupy.  I support Occupy and I am quite clear that what I object to is the degree of corporate control of our country through deregulation and a number of other dismantlings and tax code changes over the past 20 years.  

If you want to write a manifesto that people will get behind it would need to be broad enough about the basic uniting reasons people attend or it will alienate people such as me.  Your opening line about we in the United States have never seen simply isn't true and lends an air of inaccurate sensationalism to what follows.  What is your aim in writing the manifesto?

I don't know, I thought radical meant what it meant. You equate it with revolutionary, I'm sure, but doesn't that just mean &quot;radically new or innovative; outside or beyond established procedure, principles, etc?&quot; I'm sorry to poke fun but damn, aren't we by definition seeking a revolutionary change as well? Or are you not? I'm at a disadvantage here because all my cards are on the table, but I have no idea what you want to come out of this movement. Please, tell me!

Keep in mind too, that this is a declaration of occupation and that it makes no demands per se. But if affirming, in principle, a desire to see a political and economic structure that is more democratic and just makes one an absolutist engaging in lowly propaganda, then I suppose I am guilty as charged. 

Anyway, give this process another day or two and see if what comes out isn't a more soothing call to action, ok? It's already being toned down significantly, and aren't we lucky you didn't see the first draft!

The aim for the manifesto is to rabble-rouse! No! The aim of the manifesto is to get everyone on our side. No! The aim of the manifesto is to get the people already on our side to start taking action. No! The aim of the manifesto is to advocate for incremental legislative change. Noooo! The aim of the manifesto is to capture and define the spirit of the moment. 

Ah hell, now we're calling it a manifesto even!

To answer your question, burban, this declaration is intended to appease everyone ever associated, or anyone who may possibly be associated, with occupy boston without sacrificing too much in terms of principles or spirit. It doesn't mention capitalism, it doesn't mention any political parties or ideologies, it doesn't mention particular legislative demands, it doesn't mention particular grievances, it doesn't mention any hot-button political issues, it doesn't mention practically anything at all! It is simply a rhetorical device explaining that a large swath of people is upset with their economic and political situation, that the problems they face are urgent, and that they have a pretty good idea of who caused them. 

If you can draft something that says that in a way that can get most of the people in the camp to agree with you, I'm all ears. Right now, this document comes pretty close, and I'm still revising it to address everyone's concerns!

LOL, I bet we're both glad about that 1st draft.  

You don't have to go very far into the definition of radical before hitting &quot;extreme,&quot; &quot;drastic.&quot;  And, as a noun, a radical is an extremist, using &quot;direct and often uncompromising methods.&quot;  You must know this; it's not a secret definition.

No, I am most definitely not seeking revolutionary change.  I want to see some modest, thoughtful economic measures to be advocated so the Occupy groups can taste a measure of success and then develop their next legislative target.  

Revolution absolutely will not sell, so I wonder why you would propose going that direction?  Would you defend the results of revolutions, besides the very unique instance of the American one?  Every other large country's revolution has produced a mess, and I can't even imagine that kind of mess if the US gets Civil-Warry in the current state of the world.  

Any statement made officially by the occupation will contribute or detract from the credibility of the effort.  Please, let's keep it realistic.  Your declaration goes well beyond &quot; a desire to see a political and economic structure that is more democratic!&quot;  That statement in itself is the purpose I gave this morning to a snarky opponent in a stairwell.

Please, whatever you do keep it simple! There is a great book called &quot;Make it Stick&quot; and in order for a message to 'stick' it must be simple. We are all fighting against the influence of money on government. We are against corporate greed as a root cause for many symptoms like unemployment and the deterioration of life for working and middle class Americans. We are against business as usual in our working lives and politics as usual in our civic lives.

And why reinvent the wheel - look at what OWS is voicing. http://www.occupywallst.org/forum/first-official-release-from-occupy-wall-street/
(This is a living document. you can receive an official press copy of the latest version by emailing c2anycga@gmail.com)

We should all craft the SAME MESSAGE - all the Occupy movements in the country. If as organizers you want to make a difference then don't craft a Declaration for Boston, but rather gather all the emails of all the organizers around the country and CRAFT A ONE LINER SIMPLE DECLARATION - PLEASE...this is the only thing that will make a difference.

The reason why we are writing our own declaration is because ratification of the OWS was blocked during the consensus process. I wrote this with the concerns expressed during that conversation and the ones that have followed in mind. I think it serves its purpose well.

Try one more time - have Boston/NY take the lead to spread the message around the country. Contact them at OWS again with these suggestions. Trust me people are looking to OWS for some leadership and for a consistent message.

I wrote this to Noah in an email:

Hi Noah,

I am writing to suggest a new strategy for crafting the statement of purpose, which is to work directly with the OWS organizers to craft a SIMPLE / EFFECTIVE / CONSISTENT message that is ALL INCLUSIVE (aka non-partisan) and which resonates with the AMERICAN people.

I have been reading blogs on the various occupy sites around the country (USA) and a lot of people, working class and middle class Americans are behind you and some are wondering why the movements do not show solidarity and unity. 

The solution is simple. Have Boston and New York take the lead. Contact your NY counter parts - I noticed this on their site:
http://www.occupywallst.org/forum/first-official-release-from-occupy-wall-street/   NOTE: This is a living document. you can receive an official press copy of the latest version by emailing c2anycga@gmail.com.  [?? Is this the right contact]

Rules for the Statement Of Purpose:

1. Simple Message: Succint  (keep in mind that the more words, the more potential for people to mis-interpret and poke holes at it)

2. Consistent: Broadcast on EVERY 'Occupy' site the SAME message this will get the Media's attention and as a result the attention over there in Washington that this movement is here to stay

3. Effective: Promote a non-partisan message upfront  (see example below)

4. Timely: Do not lose the momentum; we know our message - keep it simple and have OWS broadcast it to all sites so all supporters can get behind the cause 

5. Targeted Audience: The American People   
    Note: It can be mention at the end that we stand in solidarity with all occupy movements around the World, with the same ideals but your main audience are the American people

Just an example -

&quot;We are an American non-partisan movement, which is against the influence of money on politics and thus seeks to promote a separation of corporate interests from our government. We no longer wish to support business as usual in our for-profit establishments (corporations, colleges and universities) or politics as usual within our government. We demand REAL change. Let the voice of the 99% be heard!&quot;

Best of luck! Be united if you want to succeed!!

A Strong Supporter

My demographic: An Independent / Middle-class / Middle-aged / Employed


IMPORTANT - get the SOP out in a timely manner so the movement doesn't lose supporters. Everyone is waiting for the STATEMENT OF PURPOSE and I would not waste any time in putting out a clear and concise message !

I did not receive a response to the request for a united message sent across ALL Occupy Movements - a short and simple one.

I feel like the Wiki is becoming like the blogs with so much content all over the place. There is a sense of urgency to publish the SOP - a simple one that a broad audience can understand. I am repeating myself in multiple threads (since there are so many...) - in hope that the message that 
MORE IS LESS resonates. Keep in mind that the majority of the audience are not academics. Look at the blogs - everyone is asking to end the influence of money on Washington.

:[[user:panagiotis1]] Oct 16, 2011 8:22 am
The following statement was written as a complement to Skeet's declaration, and is thus in the same spirit. It is a work in progress. There are elements in it that I think can be incorporated into a powerful declaration of the occupation.

We, Occupy Boston, are building a broad alliance of the discontented, the dispossessed, the alienated, and the exploited. As the 99%, we declare that the 1% will not make us pay for their crisis and will no longer corrupt the democratic process, depriving it of its significance. It is the democratic process that we seek to broaden and strengthen, letting people affirm their dignity by taking their lives and the wealth they create into their own hands, for the liberation of labor and humanity and for the progression to a more equitable and just society. As a precondition for the real democracy that we seek to establish, it is necessary that all individuals – irrespective of their race, sex, age, creed, skin color, or immigration status – are secured a decent level of healthcare, education, housing, income, and employment or retirement security so that they may participate meaningfully in the popular processes that we are developing in occupied squares throughout the United States.

We thus declare the urgent need for a society in which priority is placed on the free social and cultural development of all individuals, not on the maximization of capitalists’ profits, in which public goods and services are once more brought into the sphere of the commons, and in which workers democratically control the process of production, so that decisions regarding the allocation and distribution of our resources are made in a participatory and inclusive manner in the broader interests of our society.

In solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, the peoples of Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Chile, and all those participating in this global uprising

Equality – Justice – Dignity

The spirit of it is good and it is too ideological for a broader communication. Message needs to be simple and resonate with a broad base - the working and middle class Americans who are discontent with the state of affairs in our economy. FOCUS on the economy and economics is based on facts not ideological principles that would take generations and generations to solve. Keep the message simple so that solutions are palpable and reachable in the near future.

I am not the only one who thinks this - I am quoting another blogger right now (Saturday Marches):
&quot; there seems to be a push by politicians and pundits for the Occupy movements to define specific policy changes but that would be a mistake. In my opinion, that would be painting the movements into a corner. 

Look, PhD’s and Nobel Prize winners have been debating how to fix this mess since 2008 and there are still as many theories as there are economists. The politicians who ignored or mocked OWS last week are now asking for policy solutions? That’s like sobebody coming into your house, throwing your lamp on the floor and then demanding to know how you’re going to fix it! 

For a public statement of policy I’d suggest something like, “Washington, Wall Street and Corporate America all co-operated in driving the country into the swamp we find ourselves in today. We’re not going to take it anymore. We demand that you effect systemic changes to redress the economic disparities that exist in the United States today. You broke it, You fix it. We are watching closely.”

State the ISSUE and a very BROAD DEMAND, which is that Washington needs to find some solutions - FAST...

==But didn&#039;t the government made $ off the bail out?==
:[[user:WayneKleinPhD]] Oct 16, 2011 8:10 am
In a little town of 100 homes, there is one humongous mansion worth almost as much as all the other homes combined.   One day the owner of the mansion, Walter Street, asks the town government for a massive loan.  Reason, he has been gambling, lost his money and is in danger of losing the mansion.  This spreads rumors that the town is dying.  Home prices crash.  People get scared, stop spending money.  With sales off,  businesses lay workers off.  With fewer sales, many small businesses fail.  The laid off workers and struggling small business owners are unable to pay their mortgages – with many losing their homes.   Many of those who are still able to pay their mortgage (because home prices fell) now owe more than their home is worth.    But the mayor, who used to work for Walter Street, goes to the town council declaring that Walter Street is To big To Fail.  So Walter Street, the riches man in town, gets a low interest loan courtesy of the town’s taxpayers.  

As soon as Mr. Street receives the money he begins gambling again, is again rich and lickity split, he has repaid the loan with interest.  Meanwhile, 9% of the town is collecting unemployment and another 15% has either exhausted their unemployment benefits or they are now working only part time.  Many of those who never lost their jobs are working harder and longer hours just to make the same money.  Everyone’s home is worth less.  So did the townspeople make money on Walter Street’s bailout?

Here is a comment from the Blogs - since I quoted it there to see the reaction: 

&quot;Really oversimplified analogies are just that. Oversimplified.

Now if everyone in the town had an investment that Mr. STreet was overlooking for them, and he had a complex web of financial ties to not only the townspeople but the other local towns, and heck even other states- then the analogy might make a little more sense.&quot;
====re: But didn&#039;t the government made $ off the bail out?====
::[[user:anonymous-observer]] Wednesday, 1:24 pm
And...this was my response:

&quot;No one claims this is 100% accurate LOL — the bailout didn’t go to Mr. Street’s mansion (aka Wall Stree), but a minuscule corner of that mansion (aka a few corporations). Financial stability should be protected as that IS “too BIG to FAIL”; but let those useless corners rot, those are not too big to fail.

Am I to understand Catherine that you are a fan of the “too big to fail concept” for a few corporations? Not allowing them to fail is now bringing down MR. Street’s entire Mansion because he continues to gamble. Those bailed out did not learn, they are not creating jobs, they are still paying their CEOs exhorbitant amounts of $. 

So no need to be anal on oversimplified analogies, conceptually the message is that the few rotting corners of the mansion should have been allowed to fail then rebuilt later THE RIGHT WAY. Not allowing those few corporations to fail caused them to learn NOTHING and still mooch off our backs. Look at Trump, he declared bankruptcy then came out stronger than ever. Now don’t go and accuse me that I am a fan of Trump or anything (picky, picky…). The devil’s in the details, but it would only benefit OWS and OB to just pick a simple message and stick to it like no more bailouts or no more financial influence on Washington.&quot;

Unfortunetly, this document is to big to fit in this tiny space.  So please e-mail me a request to:   mlinder3@gatech.edu   and I will send you a pdf copy as soon as possible.

This document is designed to give those who don't understand why we're angry an idea of  what we are fighting for,  the changes we want to make and how these changes could be implemented.  

In addition, we offer explainations as to why these changes are so important to us and the survival of the United States and its people.  

This document will continue to be a work in progress until our demands are met.  

We welcome coments, additions and/or criticism in order to make our demands stronger and clearer.

==Demands?==
:[[user:spritzler]] Wednesday, 12:36 pm
We need lots of discussion about whether or not to have demands. I'll start by saying why I don't think we should.

A demand (or a set of demands)constitutes the offer of a deal to the 1%: &quot;If you grant these demands then we will be satisfied and stop protesting and occupying.&quot; But until  the 1% cease to rule our nation and stop enforcing the very class inequality that enables them to BE the 1%, I don't think we should be satisfied. 

What we want is a new kind of society in which there is no 1% with concentrated wealth and power in their hands.

To get what we want requires removing the 1% from power and then creating a genuinely democratic and equal society. This is a revolution. The kind of society we can envision, and the way it can be achieved, are discussed in &quot;Thinking about Revolution&quot; at www.NewDemocracyWorld.org .

One does not demand a revolution; one makes a revolution. A demand is a message to the 1%. What we need, on the contrary, is to send a message to the 99%. The message to the 99% is that we have a revolutionary vision of a better world, a genuinely equal and democratic society, and that we invite them to join with us to discuss these aims and to build the revolutionary movement that it will take to achieve them.

Some say we should demand a huge public works project like the one FDR initiated in the Great Depression. But what caused FDR to help the unemployed this way was not that people demanded it, but rather that FDR feared that the working class was becoming increasingly revolutionary and convinced that capitalism held no decent future for them. Whatever changes the 1% might make to help ordinary people today will be made in response to the growth of an explicitly revolutionary movement far more than in response to a movement that merely makes some demand for a limited &quot;realistic&quot; reform. This is how it works in real life.

The best way to help would be to go to Tent City, find out by contacting the direct action and outreach committees and then posting it on the wiki.

Quick note to the media folks: sometime last night (10/7) the Livestream chat tab disappeared--now the only option is to &quot;chat&quot; via Twitter, which I don't find very useful. Was this intentional? Can the Livestream chat window be brought back?

Thanks for all your work! I love keeping up with GAs from home.

::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 8, 2011 5:17 pm
It was probably I who deleted the chat by accident, but after reviewing today I think it has been reset. Check the 'Chat' page under 'navigation' on the left. Is this the chat to which you refer?

If not, then it was not I who deleted it, and I am unsure of what you mean, and I don't know how to go about finding it.

Apologies and good luck!

==Comments to Roadmap==
:[[user:terrawiki]] Oct 14, 2011 1:34 pm
1. Jobs bill.  While I'm pretty well in favor with most of the bill, I think we need to take back our ability to print money before we borrow more money.  Also, if our work is to be sustainable over the next say 100 years, I think we have to avoid mentioning specific legislation that has an expiration date.

2. All levels of education.  I'd also not say &quot;all levels&quot; for education.  If you did, and this passed, I'd become a permanent student.  And I'm not sure you could afford the courses that I'd want to take.

3. Repealing all anti-union legislation seems to set up the opportunity for yet a different kind of dictatorship.  Have you ever been part of a union?  And tried to get a certain position that so and so's brother has?
====re: Comments to Roadmap====
::[[user:bluejaysg]] Oct 14, 2011 5:51 pm
I agree with the roadmap, but the elephant in the room is our dependence on fossil fuels. I think the roadmap has to mention getting off coal (for example, if corporations are persons, then Massey Energy should be in court defending itself against 29 counts of murder) and the devastation of mountaintop removal. (Remember the break in the flyash dam?) We need to quit borrowing money to buy fossil fuels from the middle east that we then burn up, polluting our atmosphere. The government needs to quit subsidizing this horrendous industry. And our dependence on fossil fuels has led to these endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I'm not sure how to word this to be at the same level as the principles in the roadmap, because it does fit in the goal of healthy ecosystems, it's just that it's such a dominant poison in our political and economic system as well as our environment, that I think it has to surface at the roadmap level.
====re: Comments to Roadmap====
::[[user:AriaLItthous]] Oct 16, 2011 1:24 pm

==This is a democratic party ticket==
:[[user:occupyboston4ever]] Oct 14, 2011 11:34 am
This statement may speak for the majority of OWS or OB protesters, but due to its inclusion of several partisan issues, such as health care and education through all levels and tax reform, it will fall short of drawing a movement of the 99% rather the 45% that is the democratic party.  If this is the best this movement can do to act toward unity, we have gained nothing from this experience.
====re: This is a democratic party ticket====
::[[user:StargazerA]] Oct 14, 2011 1:46 pm
If education is a partisan issue, the problem is the partisans, not that we shouldn't be educating our citizens.  If health care is a partisan issue, it is only because the 1% has convinced people that if everyone got healthcare they'd loose theirs when that couldn't be further from the truth.  We have not endorsed any specific strategy to achieve these aims, and there are both liberal and conservative mechanisms to get to fairer outcomes.
I can't think of a single ideological movement that thinks the tax system as it currently stands is ideal, especially since so much of it is hidden government spending on corporate welfare.  Progressive taxation may be partisan, but since I believe it is a means to an end (decreased income inequality) I do think the movement would be open to other mechanisms to decrease income inequality.

However, I believe Occupy Boston does refute any political ideology that promotes social darwinism, that supports increased income inequality or believes that the unemployed, the homeless, the destitute and the hopeless have earned and deserve their pain.  Otherwise we'd be sitting at home, eating bonbons and laughing at the people needlessly suffering.
====16 points cover all the bases====
::[[user:AriaLItthous]] Oct 14, 2011 5:29 pm
There are some partisan points, among many others.  If the democa-pubs are advocating proportional representation, I'll eat my hat.
====re: This is a democratic party ticket====
::[[user:terrawiki]] Oct 14, 2011 9:21 pm
Stargazer...which parts are too D?  Sometimes I don't notice...

I agree with you that a specific strategy can NOT be endorsed. Too many tangles of conflicts. Also, a specific strategy has an expiration date...when a better strategy comes along. So it's better just to demand goals.  Measured results.  And then suggest strategies. You'd be surprised how well it works...

The idea is to say something &quot;basic&quot;, fundamental. If we agree on &quot;that&quot;. Then move on and define things like:

- what is basic (tent v condo)
- does it have limits (citizen only?)
- how to measure (square ft per person, per UN criteria?)

==The White Occupy Movement : WOWS==
:[[user:mocracy]] Thursday, 9:09 pm
The White Occupy Movement : WOWS

Professor Hector R. Cordero-Guzman, PhD measured the increasing interest and levels of participation and involvement in Occupy Wall Street (OWS) by tracking the traffic to the main site for the protests- occupywallst.org.

Monitoring an average close to 400,000 visits per day, Cordero-Guzman found among the demographic characteristics of the 1619 users who took his survey:

“that 81.3% of respondents considered themselves White, 1.3% Black\African American, 3.2% Asian, .4% Native American Indian, 2.9% Mixed, 7.7% Hispanic, and 3.2% considered themselves some other group.”

According to the U.S. Census Bureau 'whites' will be a minority by 2050 as the twenty-somethings that form the core of the occupy protests enter their 60s.  If the data generated by the study is a snap shot of the occupy movement across the United States, yet another minority group – the future few – are forming a power base that does not in many ways include the realities of the future majority populations of this country. 

Class has dominated the 'occupy' discourse over and above concerns about race and gender. As a minority, this aspect of the 'occupy' movement did not initially cause me to feel alienated from the  movement. If I were asked yesterday, how I identified with the OWS movement, I would have proudly answered, that 'I march under the banner or the 99%'.  As long as the movement was speaking for and to my social and economic concerns, I did not feel the need to take a second look at the racial make up of the movement. 

Two things happen over the course of the last 32 hours that have unsettled my comfort level with an unqualified identification with the OWS movement. 

1 In response to a post that I have submitted for discussion in several occupy.org forums a moderator of occupynashville.org after reading my “We The People Initiative” and presumably reviewing the subject matter of my blog (blog.erace-inc.com) made the following general comments before deleting my post:

2 - 'you did not write the proposal, it sounds like a group of people contributed to it' 
3 - 'you have abused our private messages  (PM) to Spam users' 
4 - 'you are trying to use this site to promote your blog and your agenda' of race, gender etc.'
5 - 'issues of race and gender are important but not a focus of organizing at this time'  
6 - 'you have not answered my questions about the 'origin' of the proposal' 
7 - 'your proposal is not interesting as a lack of replies attest “ENOUGH SAID”
8 
After reading the moderator's comments, I came across Cordero-Guzman's preliminary study sampling the demographic composition of the OWS movement as it is reflected in traffic to occupywallst.org. It occurred to me that there is a difference between the 99% and the OWS movement. More important than this distinction first entering my mind is the possibility that OWS movement may not include the energy and synergy of the future majority populations that will compose the 99% in 40 years time viz., in 2050. 

It is unclear to me where the hostility towards my posts on occupynashville.org site originated.. In response to the moderator, I attempted to address her concerns by pointing out that I:

l - did not Spam any users nor create the hash-tag to which she attributed the spamming
l - good or bad, I wrote every word of the “We The People Initiative”
l - have [had] no agenda to promote my blog or any specific issues of race or gender 

The only reason that my blog is mentioned at all on the site is in response to questions directed at me seeking information about the author and origin of the “We The People Initiative”. In resovling the issue the administrator of the occupynashville.org site took a no non-sense reasonable approach to the dispute that I view as a positive indication about the future of the movement in Nashville and overall.

After reading and responding to the moderator's sentiments paraphrased above, I read about the demographics of the movement. My experience in the occupynashville.org discussion forum made me pay closer attention to Cordero-Guzman's study. In this sense, the moderator's reaction to me, my proposal and my blog was helpful and positive in so far as it served as a catalyst for my reassessment of the movement is trying not to be and what that means to me. 

Cordero-Guzman's observations point out among other things that:

l - “92.1% of the sample has some college, a college degree, or a graduate degree.”
l 
The only time you reach the 90 percentile when considering the education of blacks and Hispanics, is when you are speaking of high school drop-out rates in rural areas and inner cities. 

l - “50.4% were employed full-time and an additional 20.4% were employed part-time.”

The only time you see numbers this high about employment among blacks and Hispanics is if the discussion has to do with the disproportionate unemployment rates in minority communities.

According to the study, between 60 and 70 percent of the respondents regularly use facebook or twitter. Due to a huge technology gap along the lines of economic disparities, that percentage is amplified in the negative among minorities. 

With much effort, sacrifice and determination the 'occupy' movement will hopefully not only last through the winter months but continue to grow in number and in influence. As this infant movement succeeds in harnessing the power of 'the People', I sincerely hope that it will actively encourage life experiences colored by differences of sex, race, gender and sexual orientation to inform in more creative ways the many aims and varied purposes of the movement. 

When the most extreme and I would argue necessary elements of the movement are shouting “down with the government”, the fact that blacks and Hispanics have been down and out under the current government in the many years preceding the 'Great Recession' should weigh heavy on their minds. 

As 'anarchist' champion their cause in loud and boisterous choruses, they should imagine what a black or Hispanic youth living in lethal lawless neighborhoods think when they see on television these young 'white boyz' wearing Palestinian scarfs demanding an end to current iterations of law-and-order that oppress them as they attempt to experience all the follies of their young lives with effortless anticipations. 

Feel good liberals basking in the glory of global ambitions that envision the movement spreading to places 3,000 miles away, should keep in mind that within and outside of city's limits across the country, over 800,000 kids in the richest country in the world are going to bed tonight without dinner ending a day that began without the breakfast served at the more organized occupy protest sites around the country.  

Above all, we must not forget that this movement as it has begun to define itself is not a vanguard consisting of the poor and disinherited millions that have been living under the 'poverty line' for many years.  Rather, the  occupy movement' is a vanguard of the middling classes that have recently had more and more occasions to live as 40 plus million poor and destitute U.S. Citizens have existed for years.

Just because the core of the current protesters have awakened, does not mean that it is morning in 'America' for everyone.  Now that your eyes are open to and through your own situations and circumstance, open your minds to learning from people who have turned rock bottom into a foundation for basic subsistence and survival. Remember this when the resolve of the occupy movement is tested during the bitter winter ahead. 

The next time you are bickering in your general assemblies, have a moment of silence for the voices and experiences that have been silenced by the persistent powerlessness of poverty since President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty in his 1964 State of the Union address.  These are some of the same voices that were probably a mere whisper in your ear when the economy was 'perky' and a caffè latte in chique coffee houses was part of your budget and daily routine. 

In conclusion, don't boast too loud about the benefits of vague goals, a lack of structure and a leaderless movement. The people of all shapes, colors, origins and orientations whose current situation has crushed their dreams, thwarted their goals and left them wondering in an economic wilderness might overhear you. If the movement addresses their concerns you may be fortunate enough to see them standing in solidarity next to you in the places and the spaces that you occupy.

It can and will be said that this post plays the 'race card'.  This is not the case if for no other reason than as indicated in the demographic study, that card is apparently not even in the deck!

==Original Meaning Of Democracy: Occupy Capacities==
:[[user:mocracy]] Thursday, 10:49 am
The fundamental problem with our democracy is not that it is polluted or corrupted by 'money' and 'corporate' interest. From concept to the concrete realities that have subordinated the well-fare of the majority (99%) to the bottom line of corporations, our democracy has been functioning according to its original design. 

Our democracy was designed to promote, protect and preserve the interest of private property, especially as this multifaceted task pertains to 1% appropriating the social production of wealth. The point here is that there is no 'fix' to our current democracy. What needs fixing is the participation of the 99% in the production, distribution and reproduction in our society and of social wealth. 

Some currents of political science refer to our democracy as a 'technocracy'. This vantage point has emerged over the years because politicians from across the political spectrum have fine tuned their function as 'technical experts' for corporate interest. This means that 'elected' technical experts have mastered the craft of state and decision making by privileging private property. They have engineered a loophole in the social validity afforded democracy as a concept based on 'majority rule' by giving corporations 'person' status. (Amendment XIV 1965). 

Through the legislative and judicial process (1907-2010) these extremely wealthy corporate 'persons' and their 'captains of industry' (e.g.Koch Brothers) have been sanctioned to join forces with the 'technical experts' that we elect for them. With the 'Citizen United' ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court stripped the concept of 'majority rule' of its last pretense. Since this was a pretense to begin with, the only thing that has changed is the degree to which “We the people” -the 99% - are coming to terms or not with the bareknuckle assertion of public power by the private interest of the 1%. 

This post is an overall response to several points that have been raised in reply to the “We The People Initiative” that I have begun in discussion forums on several Occupy.org sites, blogs and bulletin boards across the country. You can find the proposal on this site by searching either my username 'mocracy' or the subject heading of the original post “We The People Initiative”. The main point or take-away is that viewed (or read) from the vantage point above, the 'We the People Initiative' is NOT an attempt to reform or even to transform our government, the current political process or the constitution of the United States of America. 

The “We the People Initiative' whatever its short-comings is my hope and desire to transform and to reform the 99% of the people who are marching, occupying and protesting in and with commodities produced by the mode and means of production our government, the current political process and the constitution was designed to promote, protect and preserve. What I advocate as best I can is the presumption of the original meaning of 'democracy' – the capacity to do things, not majority rule. I understand the Occupy movement across the world but especially in the United States as the ripening of 99%'s capacity to do big things. Maybe the “We The People Initiative” is not big enough but any effort or movement that attempts or achieves less is too little. 


Princeton professor Josiah Ober authored a paper titled “The original meaning of “democracy”:
Capacity to do things, not majority rule.”

==Winter Warnings: Occupy Staying Alive==
:[[user:mocracy]] Oct 17, 2011 10:20 am
Winter Warnings: 'Occupy' Staying Alive 

Local authorities have varying degrees of leeway to require 'citizens' to vacate 'public' spaces in the name of 'health and safety'.  For example, when the temperature drops below a certain level 'homeless' persons in some cities are not given a choice when it comes to placement in shelters. The survival of the movement during the winter months can learn a lot from the survival skills that homeless persons have developed over years of staying alive “outside”.

In places like New York City, homeless children 'occupy' the rooftop of buildings and abandon subway tunnels. In some cases, officials in cities like NYC have either given up on or reach a stalemate with the homeless persons that are occupying various spaces in their cities.  Consider channeling the 'active' and 'aggressive' effort of city officials to blunt the 'Occupy' protest into spaces and places that have been abandon to a growing number of the most destitute members of our society. 

Please consider and share your suggestions about options to deal with the 'cold' and the leverage that the winter months offers officials that are counting on the 'temperature' to have a chilling affect on the movement. 

For example:

1) Flash protests in various and sundry places – modeled after flash mobs mobilized using social media and electronic devices.
2) Share and leverage the media attention directed at the movement by occupying some of the same places and types of places homeless persons occupy as a matter of survival. 

What do you suggest?  Please visit 23 Occupy URLs listed below and share your strategies and tactics for the winter months.

==Proposal to transfrom Occupy protest demands and concerns into two legislative action items==
:[[user:mocracy]] Oct 12, 2011 9:12 am
'We the People of the United States of America' 

“We The People” initiative   
- Initiative to form a consensus of our collective interests that distills the aims and specific demands of 'Occupy Wall Street' protests into two pieces of legislation designed for submission to the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate for two separate up-or-down votes.  

'The People's Act' – Legislative Item #1
- a piece of legislation comprised of comprehensive social-economic reforms of the political process, with an emphasis on the role and function of  money in our political system and process (elections).

'Amendment  XXVIII' – Legislative Item #2
- a piece of legislation that addresses and redresses social justice issues, with an emphasis on equality, equity and rights. 

October 15th  - December 31st (Launch “We The People” Reform initiative)
- a critical mass of protest synergies agrees on terms to launch the drafting of legislation as outlined below; open call for and selection of persons to form a 50 member  (one per state as determined by state and local protesters) drafting committee. 

January 1st New Year's Day  (Drafting committees formed and finalized)  
- open collaborative participation in support of drafting legislation that resembles wikipedia style submissions and editing.  'We The People.org,- .com. - .edu etc site serves as host of master documents for drafts of the  'Act' and the 'Amendment', edits, submissions to draft 'Act' and 'Amendment' must be approved by a simple majority of the perspective members on the 50 member drafting committee.

January 4th – March 30th (Draft outline of 'The People's Act' and 'Amendment XXVIII')
- general outline of first drafts with bullet point summations of key points of the proposed legislation for comment, debate and on-line voting on overall legislation as well as specific potentially contentious parts of each legislative item. Early March: discussion and debate pauses for 50 member committee to consider and revise initial drafts to be posted and voted for on-line.

April 1st – June 29th (1st Final Draft of 'The People's Act' and 'Amendment XXVIII') 
- first final draft of 'Act' and 'Amendment' posted on-line for public review and consideration followed by a popular on-line vote on the 'Act' and 'Amendment' with real time disclosure and display of voting results. 

June 30th July 4th (On-line voting and registration for 'Act' and 'Amendment')  
- on-line registration and voting for 'Act' and 'Amendment' takes place simultaneously with final results posted on website: by end of day - Independence Day.

July 5th  (CBO submission - scoring and analysis of legislation)
-sponsored by House, Senate or President, a 'citizen submission of legislation' – the 'Act' -to the Congressional Budget Office for scoring or a reliable alternative that would yield the same kind and quality of result and analysis. 

July 15th – July 28th (Draft, enlist and vote on U.S. Legislators to sit on 'Super committee' – 'The People's Committee of Congress')
- select members of Congress are asked to serve on a NON-government 'We The People' version of the 'Super Committee' tasked with putting the 'Act' and 'Amendment'  through a Congressional style committee process in anticipation of their submission to Congress employing the full commitment of their congressional staffs and expertise during the August recess. 

August 1st – August 31st ('People's committee' meet during Congressional recess period to review and comment on draft 'Act' and 'Amendment'.)  
- Legislators who agree to serve on the 'People's Super Committee' – meet during the scheduled August Congressional Recess to review the draft 'Act' and 'Amendment' for the purpose of submitting specific proposals and revisions necessary to ensure compliance of the draft legislation with Congressional rules and procedures as both pertain to the  submission and passage of each piece of legislation. 

August 31st Public Consideration of Congressional input
- specific proposals and revisions submitted by  the 'People's Super Committee' are posted on-line for discussion, consideration, revision, adoption, adaption and finally voting. 

September 6th Labor Day Weekend 
- on-line vote on the specific proposals and revisions submitted by the 'People's Super Committee' 

October 11th  (2nd Final Draft of 'Act' and 'Amendment' posted on-line for debate and commentary) 
- based on the outcome of the vote on the  specific proposals and revisions made by the 'People's Super Committee' the 50 member drafting committee produces a 2nd Final Draft of the 'Act' and the 'Amendment' 

Election Day Tuesday November 4th 2012
-  National On-line vote for or against 'The People's Act' and 'Amendment XXVIII' – same day and time of U.S. Presidential Election-  if the legislation receives a simple majority of the on-line votes, that version of the 'Act' and 'Amendment' will be petitioned to Congress for an up-or-down vote. 

77 Days between election and inauguration November 4th – January 20th 
- intensify campaign to submit 'The People Act' and 'Amendment XXVIII' to either the U.S. House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate for up-or-down votes.  Petition a member of Congress and or the President of the United States to submit or sponsor 'Act' and or 'Amendment'. 

Turn Out The VOTE!  Mid-term elections for House and Senate
- campaign to elect representatives that support passage of 'The People's Act' and or 'Amendment XXVIII' if either has not been passed into law by the time mid-term elections are primaried and scheduled.


Frequently Asked Questions 

Q: What is the purpose of the 'The People's Act' and 'Amendment XXVIII'?
A: Incorporate the demands and the concerns of the 'Occupy Wall Street' protest into pieces of legislation that are voted on by Congress. 

Q: What is in 'The People's Act' and 'Amendment XXVIII'?
A: The structure and content of the 'Act' and the 'Amendment' is determined by a transparent collaborative process that depends on the input and consideration of any and as many U.S. Citizens that participate in the process outlined above. This process and proposal does not attempt to define the 'Occupy Wall Street' protest but rather asks to be defined by the protest and the protesters in terms of the realities represented by the movement. 

Q: Does this initiative as outlined above reign in or dilute the social movement that has been identified with the 'Occupy Wall Street' protest?
A: Yes, if the protesters fail to shepherd their demands through each stage of the process or if specific demands or interest are not vigorously promoted and defended in a transparent structured public discourse.

Q: What if we can not get the support or the participation of members of Congress? 
A: We maintain the status-quo of a dysfunctional democracy that made the 'Occupy Wall Street' protest possible and necessary. It is the lack of support and participation of members of Congress in a fair and democratic process that has brought us to this point. Any request made of members of Congress is simply a request that they fulfill obligations to the country that they pledged themselves to upon being sworn into office. 

Q: What is the advantage of channelling our movement and synergies through the process outlined above?
A: If successful  the demands and concerns that the 'Occupy Wall Street' protest represent will have the force of law and become a part of this country's fundamental and founding principles. 

Q: What is the disadvantage of the collaborative structure and the nature of this 'We the People Initiative'?
A: It will expose divisions and differences that could potentially splinter the movement and surrender the initiative to groups organized by 'Tea Party', 'Religious Conservative', and or Corporate interest. 

Q: Who are the 50 members on the drafting committee?
A: Hopefully, they are professionals, academics, public intellectuals as well as state and local officials who lend their expertise to a collaborative drafting process as did those 'gentlemen' we call 'founding fathers' who came from various and sundry backgrounds. 

Q: How are the 50 members nominated and selected?
A: The members are nominated by individuals who are organizing 'Occupy Wall Street' protest in each state. Ideally, the protesters in each state can agree on and vote on a list of candidates that have views and perspectives that qualify them to represent the interest, unique concerns and demands of the protesters in a given state. 

Q: Doesn't producing two pieces of legislation require some kind or level of legal training or expertise?
A: Yes, but no more or less that the lobby firms that draft legislation that members of Congress rubber stamp in exchange for hefty campaign donations. There are constitutional law professors, city council members, business owners etc among the protesters; they should be on the drafting committee.

Q: Who will host and be responsible for designing, hosting and maintaining the website that centralizes the creative drafting process of drafting the 'Act' and the 'Amendment'?
A: The same type of people and expertise that are building and operating the on-line and technological aspects of the 'Occupy Wall Street' movement. 

Q: Who is in charge of this entire process from draft to up-or-down votes on legislation that comes out of this process?
A: You! This proposal is being submitted with the hope that it will be spontaneously adopted and adapted by the various individuals who are passionate about the issues and concerns that are being expressed and addressed in the form of protest 'occupying' financial districts nationwide. If this proposal can not be sustained by popular support and interest there is little to no chance of either the 'Act' or the 'Amendment' being drafted or voted into law.

Q: What is meant by on-line registration and voting for different drafts of legislation? 
A: Anyone, can register using basic and minimum information to ensure some degree of integrity to the voting process and results. For example, an imaged lettered verification form + last name- first initial- zip code and a single I.P. Address for each vote cast. You can vote and register all in one session on the site. 

Q: How does this effort manage the large volume of comments and responses that would be submitted and  directed at the various committees? 
A: Ideally, the comments will take the form of specific and constructive ideas, proposals, and recommendations that are scored – liked – by a critical mass of the people who visit the site and participate in the process. The most liked or highly rated posted ideas, proposals and recommendations enter the work-flow of the  drafting committee. This is similar to blog and newspaper website that list the top ten stories or post based on the number of people who read or indicated that they – liked the post. 

Q: What if you do not like a specific part of the legislation that the drafting committee produces?
A: Vote and Voice against it! Then propose an alternative. In other words, share your opinion and then your mind.

Q: What if you do not like the comments and recommendations made by the 'People's Super Committee'?
A: The People's Super Committee can only make recommendations to the drafting committee and those recommendations can only be considered by the 50 member drafting committee if they receive a majority of the vote by people like you. The purpose of including the input of members of Congress is  the  anticipation of the 'Act' and the 'Amendment' having to navigate the procedures and rules that govern the legislative process as it pertains to considering and passing new pieces of legislation. 

Q: What if Congress votes down the legislation that we submit?
A: Remember them in the mid-term elections. If a nationwide effort produces a genuine piece of legislation for Congressional consideration, the strength of your local movement and participation will determine how your elected member of Congress votes. It only matters to them if you matter to them.

Q: Is it fair or reasonable to ask a group of members of Congress to give up their August recess to work on two major pieces of legislation that come out of the process outlined above? 
A: During this last August (2011) recess members of the Congressional Black Caucus spent their free-time putting on Job Fairs and addressing the disproportionately high unemployment rate among African-Americans and Latinos. The idea behind this recess appointment of a 'People's Super Committee' is that the situation warrants it, no less than it – the situation- warranted the 'Super Committee' that has been tasked with coming up with a debt reduction package under the threat of draconian cuts to domestic and military budgets. 

Q: What do we do when 'The People's Act' and 'Amendment XXVIII' are either hijacked or stymied by one of the two major political parties in power?
A: That this is the fate of most legislation that promotes the social welfare of our society. The time table for this initiative piggy-backs on the electoral wave that will be generated by the presidential election. This will give the 'Act' and the 'Amendment' momentum and a longer shelf-life in a media culture of sound bites and short uninformed attention spans.  Anticipating a difficult road to passage, this initiative has an organizational grass roots structure that if realized will make a push for the legislation more effective during mid-term and off-years elections. Keep in mind that a million people in any one of the key battle ground states can determine the next couple national elections. Instead, of targeting weak members of congress, a national effort against any committee chair person in Congress should deprive them of their seat if the legislation gets stuck, buried or stonewalled. Any U.S. Senator that attempts to filibuster the legislation should immediately be targeted by a nationwide electoral campaign that deprives him or her of their seat – no matter how entrenched or powerful they are or imagine themselves. Threaten the power and position of a committee chairperson and or U.S. Senator successfully – once – with an all out nationwide campaign and it will send a shock wave through Congress and force either of the two main political parties to spend a disproportionate amount of corporate dollars defending 'safe' seats while making vulnerable 'seats' that much more uncertain.  It is not necessary to win every battle as long as the struggle drain their coffers. 

Q: What does failure of this initiative and the legislation that it aims to produce look like?
A: It looks like the status-quo. The only acceptable defeat of any legislative item or initiative that emerges out of the process above or one similar to it is when a majority of the people have voted it down after a fair and open exchange of ideas. If the 'Act' and or 'Amendment' gets an up-or-down vote by both houses of congress, win or lose the results of a clean and fair legislative process should be accepted. We get what we want by making it happen; not by demanding what should have been won or lost in a long struggle that starts now!

Q: What if the President of the United States vetoes the legislation or there is a Supreme Court challenge?
A: Redirect the support that got the legislation through both houses of Congress to override the veto. Keep in mind that a super-majority vote  will be needed to pass 'Amendment XXVIII' and super-majority vote of state legislatures will been needed to ratify the 'Amendment' if it passes. The 'Act' will be easier to pass, nevertheless, the goal of the overall process that produces the legislation is to mobilize a citizen power base to compel super-majorities on the federal and the state level. The closer we get to achieving this goal, the less successful will be Congressional, Presidential and or Supreme Court attempts to block or negate the legislation that emerges out of this process. It is not simply a matter of taking power from 'Wall Street' but to giving it back to the people. 

Q: What can I do right now to make this happen?
A:  - Using your facebook, twitter, blogs, email, stamps and envelops to share this idea with as many people as possible. 

- Ask people with a significant on-line presence to start a sign-up list for people who are willing to dedicate time and energy to building the site, serving on the committees etc.  

- Petition and nominate your member of Congress to serve on the 'People's Super Committee'. Start a facebook page or a Google-circle for the petition state-by-state. 

- Think about that woman or man who has articulated views that you want to be considered by the 50 member drafting committee and start a campaign to draft that person into service on the 50 member drafting committee! Promote them using the ideas that they shared with you and which made you think that they speak to an interest of the general public. 

- Start a email list of supporters that you can direct to this effort at critical points when it starts to reach escape volatility challenges by entrenched money interest.

- If you are a student at a university or college get your political science departments and law schools on board. 

- Those that have capacity on a server should offer to host a domain for the drafting committee or offer technical support for the site when it is up and running. 

- Address any concerns or weaknesses that you find with this idea by improving it with ideas of your own. 

- If you have connections to people that carry weight with law firms get them to ask their firm to donate hours pro-bona in support of this process and the pieces of legislations. 

- If you are affiliated with a think-tank, newspaper, catering company or socially responsible lobby or investment organization secure sponsorships of this idea and practical things like donating space to host 'The People's Super Committee'. 

- If a gathering of either the 50 member drafting committee or the recess meeting of member of Congress on the 'People's Super Committee' takes place in your area volunteer to staff the location and offer administrative support if you have those expertise. 

- But most important, when and where you see this idea gaining traction support it!

&quot;Money is the alienated ability of humankind&quot; - Karl Marx -Money is a commodity. It is the abilities and capacities of humankind in commodity form. As a commodity the abilities and capacities of humankind are mystified to promote, protect and preserve the power of the few to control and to regulate 'state' power calibrated to the needs of 1% of our society to maintain control over the means of production and wealth. One of the mystified forms of money as a commodity is this 'theoretical fiction' known as &quot;Finance&quot;. Revolution is a process of persisting change that must transcend the 'state'. Notice that the word transcend is used here and not the word abolish. We must demystify money and free ourselves from its current 'understandings' before we can free ourselves from it grip! It is not the aim of &quot;The People's Act&quot;, &quot;Amendment XXVIII&quot; or the constitutional convention to transform the 'state' or even to reform the &quot;state&quot; the goal is to transcend it towards the achievement of a free association of human beings realising their abilities and capacities - viz., labor and needs - in a balance that truely allows society and the individuals in society to benefit &quot;each according to his need&quot; as each contributes &quot;according to abilities&quot;.  &quot;The present is the future unfolding . . .&quot; K. Marx. It is through legislative 'Acts' and 'Amendments' that I as a descendant 'slaves' can write to you here today as a 'relatively' free person. Where do you fit into the bends and fold of a movement that has to start somewhere if it is to go anywhere! Buck Up! or Shut Up!

What is free speech, when it is not free to do harm?

In a more appeasing expression of the same, what good can free speech be or do when it is harmless? The adjective “free” denotes an attribute of speech, not a condition of it. When we dare impose conditions on ‘speech’ or accept, in any context conditional speech, it is not ‘free’. It is in need of liberation of and from those whose very existence is conditional or a condition of quieting or silencing not just the physiological act of speech, the words spoken but the truth or untruth signified by the utterance of a signifier or an amalgamation of signifiers.

‘Free speech’ is not what it allows us to say about ourselves or others. It is that we can say it, write it, paint it, shout it and if necessary shut it up inside ourselves to protest places and spaces that do not allow it and above all to profane those persons whose private or public existence requires secrecy and silence.

Interesting idea. Now that representative democracy is bought and paid for maybe its no longer relavent. Government by referendum hey! I'll have to think about that
====re: is representative democracy dead?====
::[[user:yanikn]] Oct 15, 2011 10:27 am
Representative democracy is a system. It is only &quot;dead&quot; if the majority of citizens don't fight to ensure that it represents their interests.

Is it possible that this system inherently grants a slight advantage to monied interests? Yes. However, so do many other political systems. This inherent bias may be a worthwhile sacrifice considering the time-saving benefits it confers upon the average citizenry. Does it mean the average citizen shouldn't participate at all? No.

But it does allow people to live their lives. Imagine a 300 million person GA on some of the issues that the US has had to deal with in the past decade. We would still be on points of information.

I think a major reason the system is distorted is because average people haven't been participating as much as they need to in order to ensure a healthy democracy.

Money helps politicians in an election, but in the end it all comes down to the votes. It doesn't matter how much money is thrown at the election if you have an informed and participating electorate. 

Money gives you a concrete advantage only when you have minimal interest and people who aren't critically thinking about the issues and candidates.

As for gov't by referendum: have you seen the results of that in California? Direct democracy is empowering, but it is more susceptible to making bad policy.
====re: is representative democracy dead?====
::[[user:pcovery]] Oct 16, 2011 5:17 am
Thank you, yanikn.  History teaches caution when tampering with large institutions.  Tyrants are like opportunistic weeds when the substrate is disturbed carelessly.  

I say we should keep the large visions in the philosophical discussion room until they've been hashed through a LONG time.  As Mao (I think) said about the results of the French Revolution: &quot;It's too early to tell.&quot;

We are the 99%. We do not wish to become a fourth and least powerful branch of a corrupt corporate-owned government.

We do not wish to work within a corrupt corporate-owned system.

We wish to establish a democratic form of government, a government of, by, and for the people--a direct democracy.

It is better to spend whatever time it takes to allow everyone to have a voice and be heard, than to allow corporate puppets to make quick decisions that kill innocent people, destroy our economy and pollute the planet.
====re: is representative democracy dead?====
::[[user:mymarkx]] Oct 16, 2011 11:56 am
Yanikn, do you remember the election of 2000? It doesn't matter how well informed people are or how many vote if the votes don't have to be counted and the Supreme Court can overrule them.

Money is what corrupted the referendums in California. Direct democracy is not more susceptible to making bad policy than representative democracy that represents whoever has the most money. 

As long as we have a Constitution that doesn't guarantee our right to have our votes counted, and that allows the popular vote to be overridden by a winning candidate conceding, elections officials or the media falsifying results, the Electoral College not following the popular vote, Congress accepting or rejecting the Electoral College vote, Supreme Court intervention, and other means of ensuring that those who own the country will always rule it, which was the framers' intent, merely having an informed and participating electorate won't help.
====re: is representative democracy dead?====
::[[user:pcovery]] Oct 16, 2011 1:41 pm
Of course it matters how many vote.  The Supreme Court only got involved because there was a dispute about whether some counties' recounts were admissible, and that only swayed the election because it was very close.  Math still applies.

Money would not corrupt referenda if people participated in the existing system enough to look past their TV and whatever crap is advertised there.

&quot;fourth branch&quot; while a great idea, is too specific. The specifics of a more democratic system would be worked out during a constitutional convention; the first step is calling for a cc or becoming one.
====re: is representative democracy dead?====
::[[user:mymarkx]] Oct 17, 2011 3:47 pm
pcovery, you cannot prove that the race was close. More than 92% of all votes cast in US elections are completely unverifiable. You are free to believe what the media tells you, as that is your Constitutional right to freedom to believe what you want. But you have no right to obtain the evidence to verify the results, as the central tabulators that count the votes are easily hacked by insiders and their software is proprietary. Even if you could check the audit logs, by the time you did, the candidates would be sworn into office and couldn't be removed except by Congress.

If the central tabulators are programmed to allocate 54% of the vote to Candidate X, 44% of the vote to Candidate Y, and distribute the rest among third party candidates, no matter how many people vote, the votes will always be allocated in the same percentages.

::[[user:pcovery]] Oct 17, 2011 7:21 pm
You're free to make up scenarios to speculate about, like anyone else in this great country.  My general assumption about conspiracy theories is that people are not that clever and devious to be able to pull off coverups on a large scale.  Sure, some sociopaths get away with plenty, but in the long haul, my money's on screwups outing most nefarious plans.  But you go ahead and believe what you want.  Just don't expect me to go along with you.  I'll side with exit polls and millions of very interested people involved in watching results.

I said nothing about any individual white men.  Whiteness is a cultural construct that can and has been quantified.  Misogyny is a cultural phenomenon that can and has been quantified, and harms men as well as women.  By fighting gender policing and oppression we are not only fighting for women, but also all men who don't conform to a hyper-masculine, isolated and emotionally-disconnected stereotype our society demands of them.  

We can not and should not avoid these deep-seated problems because it might hurt someone's feelings.  These problems hurt a lot more than peoples' feelings.

Banking and bank exploitation is a race issue: http://thesocietypages.org/colorline/2009/06/08/systemic-racism-in-banking-the-wells-fargo-case/

The 1% is overwhelmingly White: http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/97/07/9707jw.pdf

These things aren't coincidences.

If we don't confront the systematic, intersecting forms of cultural discrimination, our statement will not challenge the problems facing most of the 99%.  If we aren't explicit about these things, we are complicit in perpetuating them.  Color blindness is a form of racism, because it is willfully ignoring the currently-present racism.

I am sorry that I don't have a non-threatening way to phrase these things, but the truth is it is threatening.  I do expect people to have faith that even without an unfair advantage they will still have enough, and I am asking this of people who don't have enough right now.  But the only alternative is to perpetuate the status quo, only with different aggressive privileged people who are willing to abuse their privilege on top.

We can't erase racism and sexism and heterosexism by pretending they don't exist.

In principle I share many of thes frustrations, but in form I think it's best to model the attitudes and behaviors rather than pointing fingers.  I sympathize with your impatience at the idea of demurring to the status quo, but we can hardly demand a more cooperative and inclusive culture unless we can demonstrate it in word and deed.

==Concern==
:[[user:StargazerA]] Oct 14, 2011 1:59 pm
I am concerned about removing from corporations not only freedom of political spending but also the protection of members afforded by corporate personhood.  It will enable those with the resources to sue individuals, i.e. the 1%, to dominate and further consolidate their power and influence, while undermining groups like the ACLU, labor unions, EFF and independent entrepreneurs that can protect the rights of workers against well-funded interests.
It is unclear to me that the total consequences of the abolition of corporate personhood, particularly with regards to international relations and trade, have been explored.  I would much prefer to focus on repealing Citizens United and corporations' special treatment under the law.  Tax their income, stop corporate welfare, uncap damage awards against oil companies, and we can continue to allow workers to unite together to protect their interests as well.
====re: Concern====
::[[user:informantzero]] Oct 15, 2011 9:01 am
The language of proposed amendment H J Res 78 is concerned very specifically with the regulation of election funds.  While it may not seem an extreme measure, the possibility of moving it forward is increased by the fact that it is not eliminating altogether &quot;corporate personhood&quot;, i.e. it does not interfere with the primary reason it exists in the first place--liability protection.  Many Small Business entrepreneurs, which are members of the 99%, that are not corrupting politics as incorporated &quot;persons&quot; are very concerned with preserving the liability status of corporate personhood.  An honest, good faith accident, or unpredictable series of events, should not financially ruin a family for generations to come, but it may make the business entity liable to recompense.  Without this liability protection, many entrepreneurs would not put their personal estates at risk, no matter how small or large, for a progressive idea. Creative, progressive entrepreneurship should not be stifled. &quot;End Corporate Personhood&quot; is not an accurate heading for the position I've been advocating. Lawfully recognizing the differences in constitutional protection of people (flesh, blood and brains) and corporate persons (abstractions signified by pieces of paper)is more to the point.
Taxing, Labor Unions, and International Trade are all the subject of other conversation threads.

Take a temperature check at a GA asking how well informed the group is on this topic.  Making reference material available in print on site for distribution to the group and visitors to encourage conversation.

Take another temperature check at a later date making sure that the subject is not divisive to the group.

Open a dialogue with other Occupy sites making sure that any action in this direction will not be divisive to the larger movement.

==5. Change the way bankers get paid==
:[[user:reyraton]] Oct 13, 2011 10:54 am
&quot;5. Change the way bankers get paid. We need new laws preventing Wall Street executives from getting bonuses upfront for deals that might blow up in all of our faces later. It should be: You make a deal today, you get company stock you can redeem two or three years from now. That forces everyone to be invested in his own company's long-term health – no more Joe Cassanos pocketing multimillion-dollar bonuses for destroying the AIGs of the world.&quot;

To some extent, this is in:

http://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2011/bulletin-2011-13.html

I think the language can be strengthened, certainly. The basic idea is sound: risk is to be controlled and payouts happen only after a three+ year wait... but the actual language undermines that.

This is something that can be upheld.

==7. An army of accountants==
:[[user:juice1502]] Oct 14, 2011 11:02 am
&quot;7. An army of accountants. America is willing to pony up a few billion to beef up our financial regulatory agencies with accountants. The SEC needs to have as many eyes, hands and calculators as necessary to perform their jobs.&quot;

I fear that the SEC provides a clear and present example of regulatory capture at its worst (see: Adam Storch). I'm not so sure simply pouring more troops into the garrison with Benedict Arnold in  command will provide the quick, sharp, equitable, and permanent solutions we require to check the behavioral biology of the post-Reagan securities industry culture. The SEC is a severely weak and infected agency; the archetypal toothless tiger. SEC needs a massive strip down rebuild. 

For starters, guys like Harry Markopolos should have a bit more access to the new SEC than thru the veritable unmanned complaint desk he was stuck dealing with (SEC really is trapped in the 1930s; don't be fooled by the solar panels and the computers). Also, a systematic approach to ending the corporate revolving door at that agency is paramount (NO MORE BLOODY GOLDMANites!!! at the very least, anywhere near the Treasury either for that matter! ) 

An SEC 2.0 will require a far more scientifically oriented agent force. That is to say, a strict, advanced, and evolved Forensic Accountancy training program is required if we wish the culture to change. There are plenty of physicists, mathematicians, engineers out there who can track down and gotcha the highly experienced industry specialist/rogue. The culture at SEC needs a 21st Century renaissance. And I'm not articulating what that needs to be very well here. And I've been long-winded.
====re: 7. An army of accountants====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 16, 2011 3:33 am
Honestly, I think a lot of problems at the SEC come out of a lack of funding. If you put an accountant at a desk and tell him everything is fine, he's still going to go through the books.

The SEC as an institution clearly needs help and reform, but for this point all I'm doing is pointing out that it needs a budget commensurate with auditing the world's premier financial exchanges.
====re: 7. An army of accountants====
::[[user:juice1502]] Oct 17, 2011 4:07 pm
Fair enough. Though I do feel quite strongly about my opinion on this matter. And it is shared by loads of individuals who work in industry and in the trade. There is a colossal problem at SEC leaving whistleblowers out in the storm, for further example. Please do read Matt Taibbi's scathing and correct SEC exposé from late last summer: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/is-the-sec-covering-up-wall-street-crimes-20110817

We'll have to agree to respectfully disagree for now on the severity and scope of the problems at the agency. 

However, I think it would be helpful to at least watch what's going on with the IG of SEC lately. H. David Kotz (the man with the plan who tried to shake up the agency in 2009: http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/in-madoffs-wake-sec-is-told-to-revamp-inquiries/?scp=4&amp;sq=David%2520kotz%25202009&amp;st=cse) has turned up the heat in the kitchen with the release of his latest oversight report on the agency's ethics failures. I think we should watch what the Republican response to Kotz' latest report brings. A new assault on the SEC's purse is expected and anticipated down in the DC grapevine from what I hear. Here is some update info:

I'd love to assist in the expansion of the Fin. Reg. proposal page if I could be of any use. I'd love it even more if policy meetings didn't meet after 10pm (after GA?). Especially, since I can't seem to find the meetings when I am in the camp that late :) It would be terrific to sit down with folks like yourself if opportunity existed. This wiki is a very solid idea and an important base for gathering and analyzing intelligence. However, I prefer sitting with people in live fashion (doesn't always have to be in camp necessarily I hope?). Quite honestly, I didn't realize I had any power to alter or expand a given proposal page. Or if it's a good idea for me to be touching anything. I haven't even applied to be a member of this Wiki yet.  

For the moment, Rey, could I simply propose that you apply the same funding increases/resource support to the CFTC that is proposed for the SEC? CFTC needs the same help that SEC does as it has a lot of the same problems that I rave about above re: SEC. CFTC is definitely understaffed. An efficiently beefed-up CFTC and SEC would serve as the Public's two-headed (friendly) dragon in a more perfect world. There needs to be more inter-agency collaboration and intell sharing, etc. These two agencies need internal capacity increases and they need better info-sharing capabilities. And no, that does not mean a Dept. of Homeland Security-like behemoth need be created. Nothing of the sort. Both agencies have been standing behind the walls of a pillow fortress whilst carrying shoestring and bubble gum weaponry for too many years now.

OK. That's enough ridiculous imagery for one post.

Concur completely with the expectation of a Eurozone melt-down. The bailout fund is nothing short of dark comedy.

Seasoned bank-watcher/irritator Rep. Peter Welch is pushing for a DOJ investigation into price signaling and/or collusion (violation of anti-trust statutes) re: this latest debit card fee plan cooked up amongst our zombie banks. Nothing radical whatsoever about his claim. Read his letter to Holder here:

http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/dems-press-eric-holder-to-investigate-banks-for-colluding-over-atm-fees.php 

The fact that Six bank holding companies possess control over (roughly) 65% of our GDP is looking pretty counter-capitalist. I have not yet heard a serious and convincing argument as to why we shouldn't be looking at the idea of banking institutions as public utilities. The Bank of North Dakota  is an interesting system to look at for consideration, at least as a form of competition (solid lending/due diligence record there). BofND is not a one-shot solution/model but could help shape debate. Also, see Canadian banking regulatory systematics. Why can't these types of rules be applied to US banking? It's not an outrageous question.  

Some facts that hurt:

http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/top50form.aspx

My opinion on banking (above) aside, I do not see anything radical about asking our government why it cannot look at the concentrated balance sheet power of BHCs in the post-Global Credit Crunch world and take steps to, at the very least, de-concentrate banking to 2007 levels. This just to begin with!

I don't disagree with your support for the &quot;don't prop up banks&quot; meme. However, the heavy media editorial assault against #OWS movements has this week, by my opinion/observation, begun to shift towards asking us why we (in typical patronizing tone) 'think we can change anything by telling government what we don't want vs. what we do want.'

&quot;Don't Prop Up The Banks&quot; (or the like) will certainly work well for the movement in the short-term, populist sense. However, I'd like to know how we'll enhance DPUTB two or three steps down the road.     

Please keep up the thought process here. I am enjoying what you guys have written so far.

From everything I understand about the EU issue, the major players like Germany and France control the currency and they are doing exactly the wrong things when it comes to smaller nations like Greece. They are pushing austerity, which merely makes their economies tank further, and they aren't loosening up monetary policy so those smaller countries are having to pay their debts with &quot;expensive&quot; money. If Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal had their own currency they would be in a better position to fix their problems.

The Bank of North Dakota has been largely overlooked in this whole banking discussion but it has done enormously well for North Dakotans. It might be a good thing to push here in our state as an option to Wall St. It makes me think of the &quot;Move Your Money&quot; campaign HuffPo had a while back where people shrink the big banks by moving their money to smaller community banks.

Rey, you may be right about the optics of breaking up the banks. It would certainly end up a divisive issue.

I heard an interview yesterday with Ravi Batra, an economist who predicted this bubble and crash. He thinks next year will be a lousy year but it'll be 2013 that the crap will hit the fan. It'll be the catalyst for a movement to end crony capitalism, which he thinks will be gone by the end of 2015. To me it sounds very optimistic but who knows.

I'd like to know what peoples' thoughts are on all the space between the two extremes I think I'm detecting here: 1.) status quo (zombie bankery as it is) and 2.) a quick and dirty break-up of the largest banking institutions (perhaps the top four).  

I find ideas like the FDIC receivership concept to be very sound. But anti-trust laws must be enforced if they've been broken, no? Perhaps it's time to cast the die in court? I don't think it's totally out to lunch to at least consider Sherman AT proceedings. I'd wager that the public might be hungrier than we think for some busting up of the neo-trusts, at least in banking.

Fiat currencies can work.  I don't advocate a return to the gold standard.  It is the MONOPOLY issuance of fiat currency that is pernicious.

If we are also concerned about the state of debtors or the continuing limited economic growth, we might want to not rush to condemn a limited catch-up period of slightly-higher-than-2% inflation (say, 6% or so).  Inflation does not inherently harm workers, especially when most workers are also borrowers; it only harms workers if goods inflate without wages accompanying them.

==2. Pay for your own bailouts==
:[[user:reyraton]] Oct 13, 2011 10:38 am
&quot;2. Pay for your own bailouts. A tax of 0.1 percent on all trades of stocks and bonds and a 0.01 percent tax on all trades of derivatives would generate enough revenue to pay us back for the bailouts, and still have plenty left over to fight the deficits the banks claim to be so worried about. It would also deter the endless chase for instant profits through computerized insider-trading schemes like High Frequency Trading, and force Wall Street to go back to the job it's supposed to be doing, i.e., making sober investments in job-creating businesses and watching them grow.&quot;

It's unlikely that this measure would actually result in much revenue; historically these measures result in very low revenues and are ultimately ditched.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax

Even the Swedes got rid of this idea. Basically, it lowers volume of trading (so revenue generated is small), but doesn't prevent risky asset allocation.

According to the article the Swedes gave up on it in 1991 but computerized trading was in its infancy. Now computers do hundreds of thousands of transactions a second and there's no reason to believe that would change with the addition of a tax, especially one as low as .25% as was proposed in S2927.

I wasn't talking about tracking. I was talking about how computers do most of the trading now and the number of transactions has gone up exponentially since the early 90s. I seriously doubt that a tax that small would cause a drop the number of transactions in a significant way, even if the big banks spent a ton of money rewriting their software.

&quot;3. No public money for private lobbying. A company that receives a public bailout should not be allowed to use the taxpayer's own money to lobby against him. You can either suck on the public teat or influence the next presidential race, but you can't do both. Butt out for once and let the people choose the next president and Congress.&quot;

This is about corporate personhood, not financial regulation.

==Negative Income Tax==
:[[user:reyraton]] Oct 13, 2011 11:08 am
I'm working on a negative income tax (NIT) proposal with an inherent guaranteed minimum income (GMI). It replaces all welfare programs other than SNAP as well as Social Security with a GMI of 90% poverty-level (with SNAP of 20% poverty), functionally meaning that household income for every household in America is 10% over poverty.

...

The current tax and benefits system is needlessly complex and wasteful. Social Security is designed to regressively pull money from and then pay back a flat amount to every American, whether they need it or not. Welfare programs attempt to alleviate symptoms of poverty such as food insecurity and support for dependents without addressing the root cause of poverty. Income and deduction calculations are ridden with entrenched interests. Earned Income Tax Credits incentivize fraud and allow employers to offer inadequate wages otherwise untenable, creating welfare traps.
The system is inefficient and broken and needs to be scrapped.
Luckily, there is a solution which has been proposed and even promoted by economists of all stripes: the negative income tax (NIT), as endorsed by the Keynesian Tobin, the Austrian school Nobel winners Hayek and Friedman, and a host of others. In its simplest and best form, a target income is set; in practice this would be a function of individual poverty levels arising out of members and dependents in a household, though for this proposal roughly $35k/yr was used as it represented an American average of the double of (the average poverty threshold plus 10%). Citizens earning less than their target amount in gross income have half the difference awarded to them by the NIT, while citizens earning over that amount pay according the usual American progressive bracket system.
For example, a person who has no gross income for the year (a retiree or disabled person), is awarded half the difference between their gross income and their target income, or $17.5k (mean poverty level plus 10%, a bare minimum amount sufficient to live without savings and just a little more). Someone making $30k/yr is awarded an additional $2.5k (half the difference between $30k and $35k). Someone making $50k per year is taxed on the $15k they made over the target amount of $35k.
Fundmentally, the negative income tax would replace all welfare programs and Social Security, all deductions, and corporate income tax, ultimately scrapping all those programs, and more importantly their administration and compliance costs.
•    Expenses for Social Security and other welfare programs for 2009 was roughly $1.2T.
•    The amount of money required to ensure that every American household was guaranteed at the poverty threshold is approximately $800B.
•    Removing all welfare programs and the current income tax filing requirements, replacing them with the NIT, saves the government $400B and ensures that no American lives in poverty.
•    All other expenses, excluding Medicare and Medicaid but including discretionary spending, were $1T.
•    Medicare and Medicaid and associated medical expenses carried by the government cost $1.3T; universal health care would cost an additional $0.3T more (see the section on Wage Stagnation)
•    With these adjustments, target revenue for the government, assuming all programs are maintained, is therefore $3.4T.
•    All other taxes, excluding Social Security, corporate taxes and personal income tax (i.e., excise taxes and duties) were $0.2T
•    Therefore, setting corporate tax to 0% and maintaining other taxes sets the total target revenue for the NIT at $3.2T.

•    Universal healthcare should increase realized wages by approximately $700B (see the section on Universal Healthcare)
•    Elimination of the Social Security payroll tax increases realized wages by approximately $890B.

...and the real LOL at this point is that even with WW2-era marginal rates I can only get to $2.2B revenue while still maintaining a net household income increase for households making $100k or less.

Reductions in discretionary spending (Dept of Defense, mainly) can reduce the revenue target by about $200B to only $3B, but that's still $800B short.

Anyone want to play, &quot;cut the budget&quot;?
====re: Negative Income Tax====
::[[user:Stewart76]] Oct 16, 2011 8:09 am
So let's say you reach the target income of 35k, are you still taxed at the same rate as someone making 100k, 250k, or 1M?
====re: Negative Income Tax====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 16, 2011 1:26 pm
It's a marginal tax system; my own figures are initially guesstimating the first bracket runs from $35k to $70k with a marginal rate of 50%.

So, someone making $50k pays ($50k - $35k)*(50%) = $7.5k in income taxes, or an effective 15% tax rate. Right now they're paying an effective (after deductions) $2.5k (a 5% tax rate). It looks like they're getting hit harder but...

That's an intense increase over current marginal rates, but with Social Security eliminated and subsumed into this (and therefore no more payroll tax), everyone making less than $100k a year is taking home 15.7% more; universal healthcare means that they're grossing another 10%. Together, that means earners making under $100k are probably looking at a 25% increase in income.

So that $50k earner, pre- all this, ends up making $62.5k. His final, post-tax net income would be $48.75k, whereas right now he's netting $42.4k.

So he's paying more in taxes, but he's making more. It's a win-win.

Those are averages... but based on what I have right now, only those making $125k+ have a net income loss after the changes.

That said, I'm still only up to $2.2T in revenue and I figure I need at least another $1.1T, so... yeah. Might be a pipe dream anyway. :p
====re: Negative Income Tax====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 16, 2011 1:30 pm
I should add that it's not only a win-win between government making more revenue AND more takehome pay for individuals, but there's also the fact that you've secured a guaranteed minimum income for everyone AND there's universal healthcare. So there.

For the peanut gallery, that win-win comes from reallocated money normally given to the health insurance industry as part of employee compensation packages and out-of-pocket expenses, which reverts (eventually) to income after implementation of universal healthcare.

I'm sure the Mises Institute (an Austrian economist school critical of anything remotely compassionate) has plenty bad to say about the NIT.

Googling it will certainly turn up results; I imagine most criticisms have to do with incentivizing work.

Forgive me for not checking all the links but work is very busy and I want to make a point.

I have a problem with corporations going untaxed. The issue is around their use of the commons. It's not really fair to ask the public to fund the courts, patent office and/or enforcement of patents, and other business-related expenses without getting revenue from them. It ends up making our society a giant welfare system for corporations that have no fealty to us.

Did you include swapping capital gains to be counted as income? That's an extra $291 billion right there.

The problem is the corporate profits don't typically get extracted as US income, so if you do not tax them directly (and ideally in ways to keep them from playing their current shell games) they end up not paying at all.  See all those company apartments, cars, planes, schools, personal security, etc.  

Personally I would love to see corporations taxed the same way individuals are; I think it would level the playing field between labor and capital-owners.  I would also like to see additional taxes paid on profits in the case of government-subsidized industries (patents/copyright/trademark/government guarantees or regulation as in oil and banking/government contracts like the military industrial complex.)

We could also instead lower the NIT cut off, which would encourage people relying on it to move to cheaper parts of the country.  It's one of the advantages of a large country with no internal immigration controls.

I would advocate either a VAT (automatically taken into account when calculating the NIT cut off) or straight-up corporate taxation to make up the difference.  We should reexamine the budget separately and then figure out what revenue-raising measures we should be looking at.

Sorry - check the Page for an update... otherwise I'd edit the original post.

Corporate tax is generally at 10%; marginal rates and all that imposed, but low corporate taxation still.

I've started thinking of a VAT for all non-mandatory services...

==Ending Social Security is Political Suicide - as it should be==
:[[user:WayneKleinPhD]] Oct 16, 2011 6:56 pm
Ending social security - because some who don't need it get it - would redistribute wealth from many who scrimped to save for retirement and give to those who didn't.  A better proposal would be to have no upper limit on the social security tax, but to have an upper limit on what can be collected.

There's an argument against means testing Social Security. It's because when it becomes a welfare program it becomes a target for cuts. If you cut the rich out of the program, the less inclined they will be to want to preserve it.

Okay, what can we cut out of non-welfare-related discretionary spending (ie., not Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, SNAP, disability payments or the like) in order to reduce revenue targets?

My NIT target is $1T, so... let's get at it. :)

How about taking a good look a government (fed, state, municipal) pensions &amp; benefits and cutting those that may be unjustly high?

a Boston College study found that spending more than 50 percent of one’s career as a state-local worker is associated with 11 percent to 18 percent more wealth at age 65.” Private sector employees now rely on their self-directed 401(K) defined contribution accounts and Social Security payments, whereas public employees rely on defined benefit pension payments.

Beginning 1980, there has been a rapid shift away from private sector employer-based defined benefit pensions to employee-controlled personal retirement accounts. In 1980, approximately 92 percent of private retirement saving contributions went to employer-based plans; 64 percent of these contributions were to defined benefit pension plans. However, by 1999, about 88 percent of private sector contributions went into defined contribution plans, the vast majority of personal retirement accounts being set up as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA).
Private sector workers with 401(K) and IRA personal retirement accounts were advised to invest in the stock market to earn high returns plus a hedge against inflation, while public sector workers’ defined benefit pensions generally guaranteed returns of approximately 10%, including 8% on investments and an on-average 2% cost of living inflation hedge.

This is a little tricky; I'll have to dive into data to get a better handle on it.

The short-hand version ( http://crr.bc.edu/images/stories/Briefs/ib_9_5.pdf ) is that retirement accounts lost 40% of their value in the crash of 2008, and even then there's not enough money in there to retire on, as a factor of poor investment knowledge and a desire to consume over save.

I'm also aware that the pension shortfall is something like $1T ( http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/pensions-2011-02.pdf ). In some sense, non-employee-contribution pensions will eventually get an unfortunate haircut eventually just based on the budget shortfalls.

With 401k's underperforming their purpose - providing for retirement - whether by personal investment ignorance, too-large managing fees, and stock market vagaries; AND pension shortfalls...

It basically looks like no one in America is allowed to retire.

More and more I am appreciating the idea of the GMI and NIT.

What if instead of deciding how much we want to spend ahead of time, we evaluate each program on the basis of the benefits it provides vs the additional tax dollars it requires and the marginal value/Laffer curve implications of raising that tax revenue?

Right now we are on the side of the Laffer curve where raising taxes raises revenue, so there is no reason to cut for cuts' sake as long as the resulting government spending is productive.  Any government cuts should be justified on the basis of improving the net utility of people living in America, not because of an arbitrary number we are seeking to hit.

The idea that we can break contracts with public employees because we now don't want to pay I find disingenuous.  They accepted their jobs on the basis of the total wage package, including pensions, often accepting lower salaries than private-sector jobs because they valued the long-term stability more.  If we are worried about property rights or the sanctity of private contracts we should not be rushing to take away things already promised.  We can reduce future benefits, but we will probably need to increase base salaries to compensate, unless we are willing to accept a smaller candidate pool.

Below is a proposed statement of purpose that seeks to explain what we are (a collaborative effort to establish democratic governance) and subtly dispel myths that we are partisan. I strongly believe that the priority of the movement should be establishing a just form of government, and that resolution of our differences with the rest of the 100% comes when we have legitimate, functioning structures for resolving those questions (i.e. a democracy!):

We have convened in public spaces across the nation because we believe that the interests of 99% of Americans are not reflected in the halls of power. We believe that money buys results in government and that those who govern are not serving the interests of the public.

Those who Occupy have many different ideas about what should be done to put us back on track, and that diversity of ideas and passions is a source of strength. We invite all Americans to bring their wisdom and their voices to our encampments as we discuss how to reform a government that has lost the faith of the people and how to repair an economic system that pays off only for the top 1%.

We the people are sovereign, and we will have a government that reflects that fundamental truth.

:[[user:Lexikon]] Oct 14, 2011 8:20 am
I think we can all agree we're badly in need of a statement that
reflects the group, but isn't incendiary, at the same time offering
support for the movement and making it clear that it's not a demand of any kind.

There were some statements floating around the SPP message board written by groups or individuals and I liked them, but since we need only one and we should all have a hand in crafting it, I combined them, and added my own 0.02 as well.

It's pasted below, feel very free to rip it apart, edit it, add to it,
reject it, etc. etc.


When a people become beholden to a broken form of governance, they will rise up and fight for the rights appropriated to them as human beings, even as an empire crumbles around them. The American people’s pursuit of life, liberty and happiness has become impeded by a government that no longer operates in the best interests of its people. 

Once the land of freedom, opportunity, free thought, and growth, the United States sits besieged by economic calamity and oppression, the results of an inept system controlled by a fiscally influential minority that allowed corporate and personal greed to place priority on profits over people. 

We, Occupy Boston, stand together with all Americans and in solidarity with the growing Occupy movement, here and abroad, as the beginning of a global, echoing, chant of dissatisfaction and dissent with these policies. 

The current system can no longer be trusted to reform itself, as it was wrought to do, as those elected to lead us have neglected their duty to the people by failing to address the crises we face today. 

When 1% of the population controls the destinies of the other 99%, great and fundamental changes must be made in order to preserve our civic well-being. We believe in the creative ability of the people to look beyond paradigm and systemic prejudice to address and solve the problems we face. 

Therefore, Occupy Boston is engaging a dialogue to foster a national debate using a directly democratic model, which will identify problems and manifest solutions. 

The path toward a just society is clear and we, the people, declare our intent to stand and demand a relief from oppression and a regress for grievances levied against a government that has allowed a subversion of the rights of the citizens of this democracy. 

Whereas we are a diverse group but cannot yet represent all people in all places, and whereas our democratic process is both pure and thorough, we intend to issue future statements, but will make no further announcements on our collective purpose until a time when we are able to reach a consensus reflective of all individual issues, concerns and ideas of this body. 

We stand united. We are the 99%.

&quot;When a people become beholden to a broken form of governance, they will rise up and fight for the rights appropriated to them as human beings, even as an empire crumbles around them.&quot;

The ending phrase seems disjointed from the previous two. Why is the collapsing empire relevant to people rising up against their broken form of governance?


&quot;Once the land of freedom, opportunity, free thought, and growth...&quot;

For whom? Certainly not Indigenous peoples, multitudes of people of color, etc.


&quot;Therefore, Occupy Boston is engaging a dialogue to foster a national debate...&quot;

Why are we limiting it to national? Many of us oppose the global oppression that dehumanizes billions of people across all inhabited lands.


&quot;The path toward a just society is clear...&quot;

Really? I think most can agree that the path that led us away from a just society is clear, but how many of us can agree on the details of the right path moving forward?

I think that tweetlike slogans and lack of organization will distort our perception of ideas.  It is one avenue of collectiong ideas, but I want an area where clear thought and organization can be applied to each topic.  Call me old-fashioned, but I think education on each topic is essential.  

I hope the tweet-like collection of redundant topics is not going to promote &quot;voting&quot; by repetition for certain ideas.  Just because we have data-mining tools doesn't mean that they should take over our conversation, especially in something as far-reaching as a statement of purpose.

I agree and I don't think it's anyone's intention to fit our entire statement in a single tweer or to turn over our message to computational software. That said, I think encouraging people to contribute &quot;tweetable&quot; ideas help will help people to express themselves clearly and concisely as well as help others understand what the landscape of ideas looks like, without reading through 100 manifestos and distilling out the main points of each.

This is a work in progress that will hopefully be submitted, with any friendly amendments and corrections the authors find appropriate, to GA in a few days. Does anyone know if this is the right place to post it? Here goes...

Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation

The times in which we live confront us with a combination of crises the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, economic, social, and environmental messes that demands a radical clean-up. While each of these crises has its own determinants, they also all share a common root cause: the domination of our social, economic, and political order by a system designed to serve a wealthy elite, at the expense of the vast majority of the population, here and around the world, not to mention other living creatures on this planet. In light of these interlocking crises, the stench of which we can no longer stand, crises which threaten our lives, our livelihoods, our liberty, our human values, and our common future, We, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, believe that &quot;business as usual&quot; is no longer an option. The corrupt order, and the intolerable crises amidst which we live demand a profound, collective response, a popular and participatory response of the sort the ruling elite can neither allow, nor even imagine:

Whereas, the problems of economic inequality, unemployment, crushing debt, as well as corporate personhood, greed, and unaccountability, are all symptomatic of the larger corrupting influence money has on our political and social lives,

Whereas, this influence has consistently been used to impede progress toward a more just and sustainable society, and has often perpetuated crisis and war at home and abroad in furtherance of its own undemocratic agenda,

Whereas, those wielding this influence also own and control the media we require to inform ourselves about their many abuses of money and power,

And whereas, our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan resistance,

Be it resolved that we, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, acting in solidarity with occupations across America and with peoples' movements worldwide, do hereby declare our opposition to all systems of power that function to maintain these oppressive and undemocratic arrangements, just as we declare our affirmation in the belief that a better world is possible, and that it is our right and responsibility to begin creating it.

My only criticism of this document is that the sentence beginning &quot;In light of these interlocking crises...&quot; is a little difficult to follow upon first reading.

My suggested edit:

&quot;In light of these interlocking crises which threaten our lives, our livelihoods, our liberty, our human values, and our common future, We, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, believe that 'business as usual' is no longer an option.&quot;

Agreed! Also, I just realized that we promised the inner city youth, in a consensus decision at an earlier GA, that we would recognize the different plights of different segments of the 99% in our statement. With that in mind, here is a slightly revised declaration, with the revision happening in the 3rd whereas statement: 

Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation

The times in which we live confront us with a combination of crises the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, economic, social, and environmental messes that demands a radical clean-up.

Whereas, this influence has consistently been used to impede progress toward a more just and sustainable society, and has often perpetuated crisis and war at home and abroad in furtherance of its own undemocratic agenda,

Whereas, the perusal of this agenda has had profound detrimental effects on all working and middle class communities - and particularly on communities of color, youth, and other marginalized segments of our population – as well as on the environmental systems upon which we as a species depend,

Whereas, those pursuing this agenda also own and control the media we require to inform ourselves about their many abuses of money and power,

And whereas, our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan our resistance,

Be it resolved that we, the General Assembly of Occupy Boston, acting in solidarity with occupations across America and with peoples' movements worldwide, do hereby declare our opposition to all systems of power that function to maintain these oppressive and undemocratic arrangements, just as we declare our affirmation in the belief that a better world is possible, and that it is our right and responsibility to begin creating it.

The following statement was written as a complement to Skeet's declaration, and is thus in the same spirit. There are elements in both that can be incorporated into a powerful declaration of the occupation.

We, Occupy Boston, are building a broad alliance of the discontented, the dispossessed, the alienated, and the exploited. As the 99%, we declare that the 1% will not make us pay for their crisis and will no longer corrupt the democratic process, depriving it of its significance. It is the democratic process that we seek to broaden and strengthen, letting people affirm their dignity by taking their lives and the wealth they create into their own hands, for the liberation of labor and humanity and for the progression to a more equitable and just society. As a precondition for the real democracy that we seek to establish, it is necessary that all individuals are secured a decent level of healthcare, education, housing, employment, and income – irrespective of their race, sex, creed, skin color, or immigration status – so that they may participate meaningfully in the popular processes that we are developing in occupied squares throughout the United States.

We thus declare the urgent need for a society in which priority is placed on the free social and cultural development of all individuals, not on the maximization of capitalists’ profits, and in which workers democratically control the process of production, so that decisions regarding the allocation and distribution of our resources are made in a participatory and inclusive manner in the broader interests of our society.

In solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, the peoples of Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Chile, and all those participating in this global uprising

Hell All,


We cannot hope to successfully address critical problems such as Wall Street reform, environmental concerns, health care reform, jobs, etc. as long as OUR (not “the”) Federal Government remains exclusively responsive to the 1%.  

The SOP, therefore, ought to clearly and explicitly hold campaign finance reform [and/or a Constitutional Amendment (such as Sen. Kerry's or Rep. Edwards - Maryland) to permanently patch the gaping hole left by the Citizen's United] as a prerequisite, and as preparatory to addressing the myriad aforementioned policy concerns of average Americans.    

We can plea for decades about housing, student loan debt, jobs, Wall Street reform, but until we cleanse our own governing process of heavy undue influence, we can be assured that NO ONE in D.C. will be listening.  

This primary purpose of creating a more open and responsive Federal Government should be placed at the absolute center of the SOP for three critically important reasons:

1)It is something that Democrats, Conservatives, Libertarians, Socialists, and most others can agree upon.  The movement will be killed (and ignored) if it is simply a list of demands from the left that plays like a broken record.  The SOP needs to clearly invite all political views for a fair competition of ideas, and needs to fight for the same in DC.   This ought to be an American Movement,  not a Noam Chomsky, or Ron Paul movement.  

2)It is a logical prerequisite to addressing ALL other concerns.   One must clear the wax out of government's ears before we expect it to be able to listen and respond.   

3)It is highly actionable.   An Amendment is already drafted, and floating behind the scenes of congress.   This is “shovel ready.”  If fighting the fight means marching out day in day out, across the country, collecting millions of signatures, one by one, pledging citizens to vote down members of Congress that fail to vote to send the  Amendment through Congress to the states, then THE FIGHT IS ON – starting immediately.  This is clear, actionable, and foundational to all other serious concerns.

    Thanks,  Brian M.

Hi Everyone,

I am getting together a new website that may help everyone to draft the document together by using a process that is similar to that of the GA.

I put the Declaration of Occupation into the site here:
http://main.wirite.com/documents/17/

I also proposed the first edits from the current version.  These are the changes that were make from the 10:33am to 2:29pm version on Oct 14th that JSkeet put in:
http://main.wirite.com/documents/17/vote_packages/.  Maybe you can
vote it up if you like it.  Also, I know that there were a lot of new proposed things that were discussed last night at GA when the Statement was brought up.  You can make any changes that you want concerning those discussions as well. 

 if you go here:
http://main.wirite.com/documents/17/doc_settings/  you
can tell Wirite to let you know when the new version of the document
has been made, or when edits have been made so you can check them out
and vote on them.  You can also say how much time, or edits, or votes
should happen from version to version, to get things moving to your
liking.

If you send the link for the document to your friends that are in Boston that cannot make it to the GA, but that want to be include in the document, this might be a good first step to see what everyone needs in the document.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email me at andrew@flighthings.org.  I will be very happy to get Wirite to work with what we are all doing at OB.

Thanks,  
Andrew I.

Occupy Wall Street’s
Road Map To Economic Justice and Horizontal Democracy
“the truth is always simple”

OWS Mission Statement: 

Our mission is to give birth to a just and compassionate body politic that treads lightly upon the Earth.

Our mission will be accomplished when these goals are met:
1. The US has a sustainable peace time economy.
2. The voices of the 99% are heard and acted upon.
3. The Earth’s rights are recognized as being on par with human beings.
4. In allocating resources, the US government priorities the needs of the 99% who are not wealthy.

We ask that all elected officials pledge to support these objectives and methods:

5. The immediate creation of a National Single Payer Non-Profit Healthcare System
6. The End of Corporate Personhood.
7. The implementation of a  “cradle to grave” social safety net.
8. To end the assault on workers' rights 
9. To support the end of institutionalized racism, sexism, homophobia and attacks on immigrants.
10. To end the current wars and vow to not engage in another.
11. To facilitate the creation of a new tax code, written from scratch, that supports our goals
12. To pass the Obama jobs bill. 
13. To extend the pubic education system through all levels.
14. To direct government spending away from the military and towards social programs.
15. To convene a Constitutional Convention to implement Proportional Representation 
16. To repeal all anti-union laws.


It is not the role of OWS to craft legislation. We look forward to commenting on our legislators plans on how to implement the Roadmap.

While my own political beliefs are completely in line with this document, I fear that it is not at all representative of the consensus values of the 99%.

Libertarians and self-described Tea Party members would certainly not agree with much of this, yet both are represented in the 99% and within our occupation movement. I do not see a way to encourage unity with the 99% and pass this document.

This, in recognition that we're in the 6th great mass extinction event on earth, human causation, and we won't have a living planet, never mind a &quot;sustainable economy&quot; if we stay on the road we're on.

The statement put out collectively, in preparation for the 15 October global day of rage, by the Spanish social and political groups taking part in the occupation movement. I think there are a lot of positive elements in it other than the positions that are specific to Europe (but can be adapted to the US situation), and we should definitely think of incorporating some of their ideas in solidarity.

:[[user:bweckbacher]] Oct 16, 2011 12:51 pm
Ok, I've already handed copies of these demands out to people and had literally hundreds of conversations about them. They go over well, including with those visiting the camp. I will be proposing them at General Assembly tonight.

In solidarity with the Occupy movement, and the mass movements in Tunisia, Egypt, Europe, and Wisconsin, we demand:

•END CORPORATE DOMINATION!

•Make Big Business Pay! For major tax hikes on the richest 1% and Big Corporations! End the Bush-Obama tax cuts for the wealthy. 

•No more bailouts of banks and corporations! Instead, bail out owners of foreclosed homes and working Americans struggling to make ends meet.

•Hands off social security, Medicare, and Medicaid! These are good, sustainable, hard-won programs relied upon by the elderly, the disabled, and the poor. We demand jobs, not cuts!

•End the wars and occupations! Stop spending billions of dollars on wars abroad that only destroy human lives. We need fully funded public education and social services; a massive jobs program to put the millions of unemployed back to work with a living wage and union rights; a repairing of the country’s crumbling infrastructure; and developing alternative energy technology.

•Single payer health care now! Repeal Obama's health care &quot;reform,&quot; which only takes more money from working Americans to give to corporations. For-profit health care is bad for the health of the people and the economy. 

•No deportations, racial profiling, or exploitation of immigrants! Reject the Secure Communities Act. Amnesty for all undocumented immigrants. No worker is my enemy!

•Respect the collective bargaining rights of all union workers and all non-union workers organizing to form unions! Pass the EFCA and stop union busting. 

•Stop the defunding, closure, and privatization of public schools! Here in Boston, 18 public schools, primarily in low-income and minority neighborhoods, are slated for closure. Equal access to a quality public education is a right, not a privilege!

•Stop police brutality! We are demonstrating in peace. Any act of police violence against peaceful demonstrators is a violation of our civil rights. We represent the 99% of people without a say in the society we live in. This occupation is an expression of outrage at a political and economic system that does not represent the interests of young people, working people, or minorities.

•Occupy Boston will coordinate mass action to achieve the above demands and to struggle against the two parties of Wall Street.

proposed SOP: Democracy based upon an informed public acting in its own interest can wrest control of the USA from the 1% who now control it.

The biggest threat to the corporatocracy is representative democracy. One person one vote can actually defeat the moneyed interests. The trick is figuring out what we need to do to be an informed public. -   mcktimo Oct 13, 2011 1:56 pm
And what are our own interests? What are we like now? We're Americans; we all want to be millionaires, think we have a shot at it. Its in our DNA. So we support programs that benefit the rich since we hope to be rich soon. How do you change that?
That requires having people in the political apparatus to vote for. See Lawrence Lessig's new book Republic, Lost for a description of how even those with the best of intentions end up serving the moneyed interests once they are in power. (review and summary available here.)
People with very little hope prefer long odds: it's a cognitive bias that lets us have hope when such hope is irrational. It is why people are acting rational when they buy lottery tickets despite the odds: the point is not which behavior leaves me with more money tomorrow on average. The point is which behavior gives me the chance to believe I might not be poor tomorrow.
We must first convince people that a better world is possible. That we have enough to go around, and they don't need to spend their lives afraid and anxious. That everything their neighbor gets isn't at their expense. It isn't just about informing the public of the current state of affairs; it is about convincing them that they have the capability to change things (which I don't think we've illustrated yet) and that we can support a culture of sufficiency.

==What is wrong with this statement==

You should say who you want to join, not who you don't want.
====Friendly Ammendment Suggestion====
::[[user:sageages]] Oct 10, 2011 7:26 pm
I agree with the above post.

And, I just noticed that &quot;matriarchy&quot; was added as a form of sexism.

According to the history of sexism, much like the other forms of oppression the statement recognizes, sexism is an organized system of oppression, a part of a large power structure, originally operated by the dominant male group historically to control women. Sexism is perpetrated onto and against women, seeing women as &quot;less than.&quot; This still continues today.

Women have historically have been left out of political movements or ignored for their strengths. To include &quot;matriarchy&quot; in this statement, excludes women's experiences in general, the power women have as leaders, as activists and in social movements.

To include &quot;matriarchy&quot; as a form of sexism, ignores and undermines women identified folks' experiences of sexism. I propose that the statement be re-worded to just say &quot;patriarchy&quot; as sexism is defined in the statement. 

I encourage people to look at their male privilege and take this post as an opportunity for learning, not for defensiveness, (and for women in the group, also to take this as a learning moment).

Please ammend this statement of solidarity to recognize that  sexism is against women and continues to be ongoing.

Please note that I am not ignoring male identified folks' experiences of gender discrimination. Discrimination against men is real and exists. However, the historical experience of sexism is different for women than what men experience around their gender. And, so if there is a concern about the gender discrimination that men experience, that should be in a seperate line, giving both groups the respect they deserve and labled &quot;discrimination based on gender.&quot;

Thank you for reading.

In solidarity,
Sarah

I think one difficult discussion we're going to have to have about this issue is that, well, if we are and want to represent the 99%, we have to realize that the 99% comes along with a lot of baggage around racism, sexism, GLBT issues, xenophobia, etc. 

It's important that we label aggressive and offensive actions and words as not tolerated and not welcome, but I think we also alienate a lot of working-class people if we come across as politically correct thought police. 

In my view, these issues are issues that are driven and programmed into all of us to some extent, and so we need to be mindful of the fact that overcoming one's own internalized racism, sexism, etc. is often a long process of deprogramming. We can't expect everyone who shows up to protest Wall Street to have a bachelors degree in Cultural Studies. 

The sad truth is that many working-class immigrant communities have very conservative religious views that are hostile to GLBT issues. Many white working-class communities have residual racial angst and anti-immigrant resentment (especially Boston, with its violent past of school desegregation and the bitterness of the collapse of its textile industries to Asian competitors). I know this because these are my family members, or people I've worked with. 

The truth is that &quot;cultural enlightenment&quot; is often a result of middle-class privilege. It's funny because in the 1% you tend to see less of these issues made manifest, because they can all unite around their wealth. At a certain income bracket you become less &quot;white, black, brown, or yellow&quot; because everyone is just &quot;green.&quot; During Boston's school desegregation crisis, for example, rich liberals often shook their heads at the &quot;racist white poor&quot; while quietly putting their own children into expensive private schools where they weren't going to meet many kids from Roxbury. 

So we have to realize that if we want to embrace multiple working-class communities, we need to also be patient with and address the prejudices that come along with them. 

So the difficult question is this: how do we make this a safe space for everyone? How do we ensure people of color, GLBT folks, and other socially-marginalized groups that their dignity will be protected and respected, while also making people who are economically-but-not-socially-marginalized (or are in different ways) feel comfortable, and like they won't be branded as KKK sympathizers if they say something inappropriate out of ignorance or anger? These prejudices run deep, and can't be solved by a 2-hour workshop. 

Anyway, it's just something I've been thinking about lately, and I really see it as the biggest disconnect that exists on the Left in general, and a big hurdle this movement needs to address. The 99% is a big umbrella, and has elements that have been hostile to each other. In fact, the 1% has often encouraged this hostility to keep us divided (in the 19th century, for example, industrialists often used desperate African-American workers as strike-breakers when the Irish-American unions held strikes, which is one of the root causes of the racial tension that has plagued Boston for over a century). 

Again, we should in no way tolerate hate speech or hateful behaviors. But we have to focus on the behaviors and their root causes, instead of just shouting &quot;Bigot!&quot; and kicking them out. 

Anyway, bell hooks talks about this way better than I can, so I'll just leave with one of her best quotes:

“It is necessary to remember, as we think critically about domination, that we all have the capacity to act in ways that oppress, dominate, wound (whether or not that power is institutionalized). It is necessary to remember that it is first the potential oppressor within that we must resist – the potential victim within that we must rescue – otherwise we cannot hope for an end to domination, for liberation.” 
― bell hooks, Talking Back: Thinking Feminist, Thinking Black

The above from BookofAmmon is wonderfully reasoned and captures an essential element of the struggle to be inclusive. Unrepresented communities are mistrustful of white upper AND middle class privilege as they struggle daily simply to survive. We need to figure out how to bridge this divide. It will not be easy.

Much as I agree with the solidarity statement, I agree with Ammon and jaldenh that this is more complicated than we'd like it to be.  Maybe a shorter statement, something like: 
&quot;We value peaceful cooperation, so we each try to listen respectfully and understand different experiences and views.  E pluribus unum!&quot;

I really want to participate in this working group, real time, but 10 pm is just not realistic, for me, and for other people. Is any one from real time SPP monitoring this discussion? Can you move the time around and announce it here? How about posting minutes? And posting a copy of the draft proposals? I saw one once, but there was just one and Chris didn't want to let it go.

A general thought on this issue:

I wonder if we could use Google Voice to set up conference calls at working group meetings? Basically someone puts their smartphone on speakerphone, and they can &quot;host&quot; up to 4 people over conference call. So you could have people calling in to participate remotely.

It seems to be a general issue with working groups and scheduling meeting times, and could at least give a chance for people to participate if they're not able to stand around in Dewey at the time.

Aria &amp; Reyraton: I could not attend the meeting on Sunday and Monday was just crazy with all the arrests.  Last night I went in again to the GA, but there was no spp meeting afterward, at least not one that I could find.  And there was no mention of this group or any announcements from this group at the GA, as there was the first night I attended.  I will say that the GA meeting was definitely more organized, but it doesn't seem like this particular group has much cohesion on site.  Needless to say I have been following your posts on the fair tax and on healthcare, and I like what you're saying.  So keep posting!!  I may head in again tonight if I do I'll let you know what I find out and I will definitely try to get them to use this forum more often.

There is an actual site-based SPP Working Group. It usually meets at 10pm after GA. I'm guessing that the members are too overwhelmed to deal with the virtual world/are in jail. 
I got this contact name by sending an email through this system to all 96 people on the OB list. Doing it again/writing to this person might be a good idea.

This is the first time I've been on the wikispaces, so I'm just now seeing these concerns. SPP didn't meet last night because most people interested were either not there or preferred to postpone the meeting because of all that happened on Monday. There will be a meeting tonight at 10:00pm, where we will discuss some of these issues, and hopefully moving the meeting time on some days so that it can be more convenient for everybody. If you would like to contact me my email is pangelop@fas.harvard.edu and there is also a google group

3 pm is good for me, except that it costs me $10 to park each time I come before 6pm.  And that cuts into my beer budget.  But I'm OK not being at the meetings, if the info is posted and &quot;some&quot; conversation happens online, like via the email list. I like email.  I type even in my sleep.

Healthcare should be a RIGHT!
====re: Single Payer Healthcare====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 10, 2011 11:55 am
Here's some good data:

•    In 2009, 5.7% of GDP was paid towards private insurance premiums (approximately $800B, though $130B was recovered as employer deductions for a net of $670B) and 2.1% of GDP was paid from out-of-pocket expenses (approximately $300B): a net $1T  was spent from the American employee’s wages and compensation for healthcare last year.

•    8.2% of GDP was paid by the government for Medicare, Medicaid, Veteran’s, Worker’s Compensation, and associated healthcare, as well as the noted $130B in employer deductions. This is approximately $1.3T, and is paid for by extant taxation.

•    Total yearly expenditures within the United States on healthcare accounted for 16.6% of GDP, or $2.3T.

•    No other universal healthcare system in the world pays more than 11.4% of its GDP in healthcare, yet most outperform the United States’ medical system. In America, that 11.4% of GDP conservatively implies a total cost for universal, American healthcare of $1.6T.

•    Government is already expending $1.3T a year on healthcare; only an additional $300B in taxation would be required in order for the American government to fully fund a universal healthcare system.

•    Taking $300B away from the $1T paid towards healthcare by or for employees leaves a net $700B belonging to employee compensation and wages which would otherwise be spent: this money, now not needed to pay for healthcare, converts into wages.

•    Universal healthcare would therefore increase the average employee’s wages by $3500 as well as provide total access to healthcare and uncouple employee compensation from healthcare, as well as create a more moral and dramatically less expensive healthcare system.

Will this have an effect on rising healthcare costs?  I gather that rising costs are due to an aging population (and especially extreme care in the last months of life) as well as maybe liability insurance.  I think we'd need to say something about cost containment if we mention healthcare, in order to be credible.
====re: Single Payer Healthcare====
::[[user:theTempest]] Oct 11, 2011 4:43 pm
The biggest problem with healthcare is that besides nurses and lower level staff there are to many large costs in the system. The doctors &amp; high ranking administrators are taking home too much money. In Manchester NH there is a small, some might say mid-sized hospital - it is a Catholic Hospital - that the CEO is paid over a million $$ a year. Nice Catholic hospital!

pcovery; healthcare cost rise because of the profits payed to CEO's, etc. and stockholders. In a good non-profit system preventive medicine will bring down overall costs. TR Reid's book, &quot;The Healing of America&quot; is a good overview of healthcare systems worldwide. In anycase, we should not get into the details of legislation, that's not our job. Broad general demands will work best. Let legislators sort out the details.
====re: Single Payer Healthcare====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 11, 2011 7:45 pm
Public healthcare is generally based on collective bargaining between what is essentially a doctor/caregiver's union and the government to set fees for services.

Regarding cost containment, there's not a lot to say. The population is aging and end-of-life care is growing more desperate/expensive all the time, but that's happening regardless of the healthcare delivery model. 3% growth, year-on-year, is a lot more easily contained when your baseline is 12%, rather than 17%.
====re: Single Payer Healthcare====
::[[user:reyraton]] Oct 11, 2011 7:47 pm
I'd also add that details are important, since perception of feasibility is going to be a large hurdle.

This is a moral issue: do you believe it is right to PROFIT from another human being's illness? The owners of health insurance companies make millions because everyone gets sick.

Healthcare should be taken up by this movement, because eventhough obamacare was a start, like aria said, the goal of our healthcare system should be to provide the best quality care in the world, not to make more money.

Strategically, the only thing that really matters right now -- and where the Occupy Movement has had its greatest success, thus far -- is winning the hearts and minds of the broad U.S. population.   An important reason for this has been the movement's elemental focus on Wall Street greed, extreme inequality, and the corruption of money in our political system.   These are hugely important problems that the 99% can actually agree on.  We should not get more specific at this time because that will needlessly complicate a message and likely weaken the Occupy Movement's appeal to the broad public.

Boycott elections - take the remaining legitimacy of the 1%’s government!

Boycott big banks and corporations - take away their power!

Occupy Together movement has been implementing a model of a horizontal democracy in order to have a conversation between the 99% and the 1%. The movement has grown and the general public becomes more and more aware of this platform where everyone gets their voice heard. Yet the 1% through their controlled media outlets demand… demands! They simply refuse to listen. They refuse to hear us!

It was their turn to speak up yesterday, last week, a year ago. But they still don’t talk to us. Even as our invitation for a conversation is louder than ever. Most importantly they continue to do what they do best - preserve the status quo, preserve the rotten system.

The 1% shouldn’t expect a policy draft to come out of this movement. It’s not the point. When a list of clear demands comes out of the 99% it will be ridiculed, ignored, or sort of debated in a regular blah blah blah fashion on shiny TV screens. And then some other important events will occur, say another bird/pig/squirrel flu, a new war, a tsunami, and the conversation will be shut down for the reasons of national security.

No one expects bringing change to be an easy task. It might require just quite a bit more effort than occupying and marching and chanting.

By boycotting the elections (all forms) 99% can take away the remaining legitimacy of the government, which is perceived as an agency representing 1%’s interests. This is a LEGAL and PEACEFUL form of protest! This will make further, and possibly more drastic, actions of the movement justifiable. Like not paying taxes. Like disobeying illegitimate government’s authority.

Simultaneously though we need to boycott big financial institutions and corporations. The wealth of 1% enabled the corporatocracy. And their wealth is largely created from the hard work and earnings of the 99%. Taking our money from big banks is the first step. And then boycotting the products and services of irresponsible corporation, followed by workers’ walk-outs, general strikes, etc.
It’s in our hands.

The boycott banks protest started in response to bofa increasing fees for customers, because new regulations were making it too hard for their CEOs to make their million dollar salaries.  Rather than take a pay cut they opted to charge their customers.  The other big banks have not done this yet (except for maybe citibank).  My point is not all big banks are reckless.  So let's make sure we punish the right ones with this protest.  (td bank is a great bank for example)

Voz: instead of boycotting the election...I think it would make a bigger impact if we used the primary to make a statement about campaign finance reform.  Let's say instead...we all register republican and vote or write in Buddy Roemer for the republican candidate.  He is the only republican candidate taking about this issue, and the only one not accepting PAC money.  As such he gets no media attention and doesn't have enough support to be included in the debates.  Dont you think it would be a bigger FU to the 1% to vote for the candidate they spent sooooo much money trying to keep quiet?  Your vote does count, use it.

Below (How do I attach documents?)

Occupy Wall Street’s

Road Map To Economic Justice and Horizontal Democracy

“the truth is always simple”

OWS Mission Statement:

Our mission is to give birth to a just and compassionate body politic that treads lighly upon the Earth.

Our mission will be accomplished when these goals are met:
1. The US has a sustainable peace time economy.
2. The voices of the 99% are heard and acted upon.
3. The Earth’s rights are recognized as being on par with human beings.
4. In allocating resources, the US government priorities the needs of the 99% who are not wealthy.

We ask that all elected officials pledge to support these objectives and methods:

5. The immediate creation of a National Single Payer Non-Profit Healthcare System
6. The End of Corporate Personhood.
7. The implementation of a  “cradle to grave” social safety net.
8. To end the assault on workers' rights
9. To support the end of institutionalized racism, sexism, homophobia and attacks on immigrants.
10. To end the current wars and vow to not engage in another.
11. To facilitate the creation of a new tax code, written from scratch, that supports our goals
12. To pass the Obama jobs bill.
13. To extend the pubic education system through all levels.
14. To direct government spending away from the military and towards social programs.
15. To convene a Constitutional Convention to implement Proportional Representation
16. To repeal all anti-union laws.


It is not the role of OWS to craft legislation. We look forward to commenting on our legislators plans on how to implement the Roadmap.

10. Probably should trim &quot;not engage in another&quot;, though I'm sure you put it in there for a reason.

12. We can actually do better than this one, and presumably argue a better case than him as well.

13. How is this paid for? What are the figures involved? Education economics is one area I'm ignorant of.

Regarding #12: 
We're not here to throw politicians a bone.  

The greed of the corporations and 1% controls our country's political landscape. Both parties and the politicians are at best complacent in watching the the 99% suffer while the 1% prosper. And in many cases are lending the 1% a helping hand. 

Putting the support of OB behind something so specific that has come from those politicians, particularly something that is currently in the middle of a heated debate in DC changes the dialogue of these protests from &quot;The 99% vs the 1%&quot; to &quot;Democrats vs Republicans.&quot;  

Agreeing with reyraton, we can't trust the establishment.  When we say money/the 1%/ capital, controls the politicians that implicitly means that without systemic changes politicians can't and won't represent the interests of the general population.
====re: Roadmap to Economic Justice and Horizontal Democracy====
::[[user:AriaLItthous]] Oct 14, 2011 5:40 am
#12. It's important to give something to our liberals &amp; union members that is more concrete, less idealistic, more real time. Remember, even if OWS nationwide were to ratify this, it would still be the beginning of a very long process. We do need Obama.
====re: Roadmap to Economic Justice and Horizontal Democracy====
::[[user:andrewlab]] Oct 14, 2011 6:39 am
I disagree that we need Obama.  He isn't a particularly strong rallying point for liberals currently. I doubt that throwing in one point about one bill Obama might not even get passed is going to change any minds about Occupy. And even if it could, I think that my point still stands that this kind of support makes the movement sound like it is a part of the &quot;Democrat vs Republican&quot; dialogue that we are trying to break out of.  
I think 5,6,10,14 are all fairly concrete and avoid that problem.  If there is still concern that they are too idealistic, or not concrete enough, I think:
1) We should remember that this is still small and keeping up with national politics is likely unrealistic.  Our horizontal organization is great for now, but moves too slow to try to be involved in the arguments on capital hill.
2) I'd suggest we focus on local issues (MA or Boston).  I think this will have a better potential for our outreach (sounds like that is what you are going for with 12?) and avoids my concerns with supporting Obama/his politics.
====re: Roadmap to Economic Justice and Horizontal Democracy====
::[[user:AriaLItthous]] Oct 14, 2011 8:25 am
RE:#12 &amp; Obama; if you heard he was going to say something positive about OWS; you'd ask him not to?
1)This is why we make broad statements and make Them respond to us. 
2)I disagree. No local issues. Boston should aim for leading the OWS movement by getting the most far reaching demands out first. Everything that comes after will dilute it.
====re: Roadmap to Economic Justice and Horizontal Democracy====
::[[user:andrewlab]] Oct 14, 2011 9:13 am
Obama saying a positive thing about OWS is very different than OWS supporting bills that he is proposing. 

If we are making broad statements and looking for responses then why would we support specific policies? If we are trying to lead OWS with far reaching demands why would we support specific policies?

I don't mean to be petty or obstructionist. I think the list you've created the best one I've seen to date (from Boston). But #12 comes across as very partisan and doesn't fit with the tone or type of demands made in the other numbers.  I'll strongly oppose including that in any statement Occupy Boston makes currently.

Hopefully I've made my position clear - I don't want to clog up this thread with my voice on this point.  If you'd like to continue this discussion Aria, feel free to email me (andrew.labak@gmail.com)

I like 5, 6, and 7.  I think 8&amp;16 can be combined.  I am not against 9, but we have laws against discrimination already, I think this is more of a generational problem, also immigration reform should be a separate issue.  I also agree with reyraton on 10, not engaging in anymore wars is a dangerous position for our country to take.  I think 11 should say specifically that a new tax code should be progressive, and serve to decrease the earning gap bw rich and poor.  
I like the Obama bill...but if people have an issue with supporting him, then maybe word it &quot;pass a jobs bill that....&quot;
13 needs to be written better and should also encompass reform for grades k-12.
14 is two separate issues talk about military in 9 and increasing spending on social programs here
15 I don't really know much about this, so if anyone else does it would be great to hear your thoughts.

==Preliminary issue survey results: READ IF YOU ARE FORMULATING A LIST OF DEMANDS==
:[[user:jsager99]] Oct 17, 2011 6:03 am

For results go to link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2b1NawJhhmdXBOm9RySsZRcAIOcl4jhhMBV--CiIwU/edit?hl=en_US


I have begun my analysis of the data that I collected during my survey. I have 180 responses which have given me a rough estimate of the values of the collective group. I divided the answers into three catagories: low, Middle, and high. The low category (score of 0-3) is composed of the people who would not support the proposal in any way, and would likely be difficult to persuade otherwise. The middle category (score of 4-6) is composed of the people who are on the fence and could possible be swayed to the one side or the other. The high category (score of 7+) is composed of the people who will support the proposal no matter what.

By finding the ratio between those who would support a proposal and those who wouldn't, I can estimate the general levels of support that a proposal to the GA would receive. Any issue that has a high ratio would likely be passed without much debate or blocking. For example: a ratio of 3 or above means that at least 75% (enough to overcome a block) of people would be at least OK with a proposal if not happy about it passing.

The ratio is not a percentage of support but rather a ratio of high support data point to low support data points. To use the Glass-Steagall results as an example: You read it at a support of 75% where the actual results show support of 75:1 (for every 75 positive votes, I received one negative vote; there were 2 either very low or block votes compared to 150 very high or high votes).

Using a fairly large margin of error, any issue with a positive:negative ratio of more than 10 would probably be easy to pass in a GA. A ten to one ratio would mean that there would be over 90% support for the issue, even taking into account the block potential and the margin of error in my study, I posit that it would likely pass once we are actually talking demands.

Keep in mind, the middle level of support is composed of those without strong opinions and thus open to convincing either way. This middle category will make up their minds on the issues as we vote on the issues and thus the deciding factor in some of these issues will be convincing those people on the fence or ignorant of an issue.
IMPORTANT NOTE: There were numerous write in questions, mostly involving rights of free speech and minority protection. I have not ignored these, and will release an analysis of the write in values soon.

To anybody who is creating a list of demands or guiding values:

My analysis is not extremely accurate as the sample size is far lower than I would like but it is a good guide as to what might pass the GA in a proposal. My study was intended to find which issues hold the most common ground and thus would be EASIEST to pass in the GA. If you want to expedite the messaging process, this analysis will help you select a series of demands that would be as uncontroversial and quick to pass as you can. I believe that we need to release a unified message soon, lest we risk losing cohesion by focusing entirely upon the process but lacking any substance.

==World Government Working Group?==
:[[user:occupyboston4ever]] Oct 16, 2011 12:23 am
I just read an article reporting ties between George Soros and Ad Busters, the Canadian magazine that started the occupy wall street protests.  I am pleased that this movement started with its focus on the big banks and sought to change deep rooted injustices that exist in our system.  However, I am far from an internationalist, and shirk at the idea that this movement wants to extend its influence internationally.  There was a post on occupy boston that called for the spread of Democracy worldwide.  This sounds like the Bush doctrine of spreading democracy.  I don't support this doctrine.  I believe the US should mind its own business.  A world government working group is way beyond the scope of a movement like this.  We still have yet to embrace one single issue, and people are talking about worldwide revolution.  This kind of attitude plays directly into the internationalists hands, and is easily manipulated.  If a movement like this wants to be serious, it needs to focus on issues that are immediately presentable and have clear solutions.  If we want to help the world, the first thing we need to do is take away the rights of corporations right here on our own soil.  We need to take control of our money supply and stop giving corporations easy credits and subsidies.  Do that, and then you can start talking about the next step.
====re: World Government Working Group?====
::[[user:Stewart76]] Oct 16, 2011 7:05 am
This is a good point and I agree with you about not forcing our ideals on other countries.  On the other hand this movement has already gone world wide: first the Arab spring, then the European summer and now the American autumn.  If we are talking about standing in solidarity with these movements, that's one thing, but it's pretty naive and egocentric of us to think we would be leading the way on this or that we have any influence over those protests.  If anything, it was the international community that inspired us.

====re: World Government Working Group?====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 17, 2011 1:37 pm
i believe the arguments against a world-wide working group ignore some important observations.
1. (pointed out by Stewart76) we are already world-wide. we have become connected not only via social media, but also via world trade. to assume that capitalism exists only in the USA (as implied by occupyboston4ever and reyraton) is to completely ignore the fact that we are a globally interactive species.
2. a global working group is not an 'international' entity - it is one that does not recognize national borders. a global working group addresses human organizational issues without subjugation (whether national, religious, generational, etc). a global working group would be an ongoing, open event, inviting participation by all who have become aware of its existence.

arguments for 'attacking' only those issues prevalent on 'our own soil' are egotistical and naive - it is the assumption that we are not interconnected, that the USA is a body that can be purely separated from the rest. 

arguments for 'taking control of our money supply' assumes that the institution of money is one worth prolonging. while this may prove to be true (highly doubtful), it ignores many conversations that must come first. of these conversations, we cannot ignore the gathering (more obviously 'together' than current mediums allow) of global voices to address the primary causes of strife in human experience. to hold this conversation only at local levels is absurdly naive. 

while it is not occupy boston's responsibility to create a global working group, in assessing justice there is for all of us an obligation to be aware of the sum of human knowledge. to see more thoughts on this issue, please visit GAPP 10 and discuss.

I agree with OneKarma.

You can oppose the idea of a world government, while still supporting the idea that--in a prosperous and free society--all human beings should endowed with certain unalienable rights, irrespective of their race, creed, or income level. 

We should recognize that the struggle we are engaging in here in Boston is connected not only with movements within our borders, but also with movements far beyond. 

There is already a de-facto world government: multinational corporate power. We are stronger if we oppose its excesses together.

==Symptom, Reform, Root, Vision==
:[[user:matt.gabrenya]] Oct 14, 2011 1:14 pm
Hi all,

I have not been involved with the policy group, but I came up with a document that I think could really help us.
http://bit.ly/occupy-paper
Take a look at it, and if you like the idea, expand it.



It is an outline to organise the many diverse ideas about

    - Symptoms, or the overt pains that people experience and obvious failures of the economy and political system -- what has sparked and brought many people into the occupy movement.
          -  Reforms, or specific, tangible and short-term ways to alleviate the symptoms.
           - Roots, or the root causes that make these symptoms constantly arise.
           - and Visions, or long-term ideas to address the roots.


I think this could be very helpful for us to:
    1. To compile the many social issues that have brought people into the Occupy movement.

    2. To compile the many different ideas people have about solutions, and make a distinction between solutions that address the symptoms we experience, and solutions that address the root cause of those symptoms.

    3. To help us see our movement as the sum of all its parts, not the lowest common thing everybody can agree on. Even if there is some internal contradiction and disagreement on the edges, the mass of our movement is directed in the same way. This diversity is what gives us strength.
====re: Symptom, Reform, Root, Vision====
::[[user:
            
          ]] matt.gabrenya
The idea is that instead of coming up with very some very general, and some very specific ideas about problems and solutions -- we should format these ideas as 'Symptoms', 'Reforms', 'Roots' and 'Visions'

this will help us better organise our understanding of the problems and the solutions.
====re: Symptom, Reform, Root, Vision====
::[[user:

I'd agree that we could consolidate all of the &quot;symptoms&quot; together. But Reforms are, again, solutions/mechanisms to get to goals.  So that's separate from both symptoms. And separate from mechanims.  I see Roots as the same thing as Symptoms. So that can stay.  Visions are goals, and should go with the goals stuff...which is, IMHO breaking up into the separate goals, to be addressed specifically.

@terrawiki: I think it could be useful to think about each of the 'symptoms' on their own, just so we can compile the various ideas folks have about reforms to address each, and their root causes. Rather than just having a huge list of symptoms and huge list of reforms, this way we can go more detail in laying out specific ideas to solve specific symptoms.

I don't think this would/should be released publically, but I think the format could be very useful for us to figure out the sum of everyones various problems and solution ideas.


@ariaLitthous -- I think that right now we have a &quot;paralysis of no-analysis&quot; -- lots of people are waiting on occupy to come up with a plan to move forward in addressing all the symptoms. We are trying to come up with one, but it will likely be very broad, and not move us forward in coming up with specific tangible reforms we can win. 

I do not think it is our job to come up with broad problems or reforms, that &quot;our&quot; legislators will then take off with. We need to come up with the specific solutions, and force our legislators to comply.

Also, what do you mean by &quot;winner take all system&quot; as a root cause? Of what symptoms?

Winner take all is the US electoral method that shuts out most voices, those not dem or republican.

Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation

Alright, so I just realized that we promised the inner city youth, in a consensus decision at GA, that we would recognize the different plights of different segments of the 99% in our statement.

In addition to disliking the overall tone of manifesto, I disagree with these parts, strongly:

&quot;the likes of which we in the United States have never seen before: a toxic mix of financial, economic, social, and environmental messes that demands a radical clean-up.&quot;  The current situation in no way compares to the mess before the Civil War, or the Great Depression or even the uncertainty after the Revolution.  Also, we are not in any way agreed on the need for &quot;radical&quot; anything.  Similarly, this is overblown and will alienate a lot of us: &quot;'business as usual' is no longer an option. The corrupt order, and the intolerable crises amidst which we live demand a profound, collective response, a popular and participatory response of the sort the ruling elite can neither allow, nor even imagine.&quot;

&quot;system designed to serve a wealthy elite&quot; History shows there have been many interests and factors affecting our system.  It is too simplistic to say it was designed to entirely suit one group.

&quot;those pursuing this agenda also own and control the media we require to inform ourselves&quot; This is outdated and irrelevant to your conclusion.

&quot;our peacefully gathered democratic assemblies are amongst the last uncorrupted arenas we have to educate ourselves and plan our resistance&quot;  Yet another controversial and unsupported claim.  

I think it's important to keep our feet firmly planted in present reality and to build slowly within the existing system.  Great disturbance will, justly, have little support because history has shown it to be a breeding ground for tyrants.

====re: Proposed Occupy Boston Declaration of Occupation====
::[[user:JSkeet]] Oct 16, 2011 11:28 am
To Aria: This is a declaration of occupation, which is intended to outline general grievances and a path toward a participatory response, ie our occupations, GA's, and popular movements. 

It is NOT intended to present demands. If it is your vision to write a declaration that also includes demands, that is your prerogative and I highly anticipate seeing it and the discussion it sparks. However, I know for a fact that it will not pass GA, as there are many people involved in this movement that do not want to see demands put forth at this time. 

My personal intention in writing this was to get something together that I thought WOULD pass GA: a declaration in support of the principals of democracy and social justice that we COULD all agree on, something that will go a long way toward offering up a more cohesive identity for this movement and perhaps lend itself toward drafting a list of demands in the future.

To Charlie-Boo: We are all here because we are in general agreement that somehow, this system serves the few at the expense of the many. However, naming that system outright gets contentious and divisive: is it capitalism, is it the state, is the the fed, is it corporate influence in politics? This statement was meant to capture all of those sentiments and more in a way that was not divisive, and that rested upon a shared vision for a democratic and just society. Doing anything other than that is going to get whatever proposal you come up with rejected by the GA.

To pcovery: I'm willing to alter the intro to speak for our generation instead of the entire US history. I'll post the revision when I come up with it. However, I disagree that we have not more or less agreed on the need for radical solutions to our current problems: how else would you explain the popularity of a movement that has, thus far, firmly planted itself outside of the established political process, and whose language - in the form of the solidarity statements we write, the declarations some of our movement has ratified, the chants that we yell, and the actions that we take - is indeed demanding a radical departure from business as usual. I mean, did you SEE the document we passed in support of the Oct 15th day of action? Does that sound like business as usual to you, or that we are not clear on wanting a sharp break with the status quo?

Also, I too believe that many factors and factions, not all of whom are wealthy, affect the society under which we live. I am not convinced, though, that our current economic and political system is fundamentally designed to cater to any of their interests over the interests of the wealthy, which is why I included that section. 

The part on media may indeed be a weak point in the document. I'll consider revising, but keep in mind that I do not find it irrelevant to the conclusion at all, which is basically saying that it is only through a process like the one we have initiated with our movement - that is, a process outside the established and mediated channels of discussing political and economic theory and action - that we can begin the collective process of affecting the change we require. I feel that the spirit on our movement is very representative of this idea. To be clear, though, I do not believe that our movement has a monopoly on the &quot;correct&quot; process for political and economic change - just that, if we were to rely solely upon established channels to be having these discussions, we wouldn't be having them at all right now.

As to the part referring to our assemblies, I believe it ties into my last point about the necessity for beginning these processes outside the established political channels, and I believe that if there is any lesson to be learned from the last year of political movements worldwide, it is that there is a widespread belief in just such a sentiment, as well as in the power of parallel democratic assemblies.

::[[user:

Hell All,


We cannot hope to successfully address critical problems such as Wall Street reform, environmental concerns, health care reform, jobs, etc. as long as OUR (not “the”) Federal Government remains exclusively responsive to the 1%.  

The SOP, therefore, ought to clearly and explicitly hold campaign finance reform [and/or a Constitutional  Amendment (such as Sen. Kerry's or Rep. Edwards - Maryland) to permanently patch the gaping hole left by the Citizen's United] as a prerequisite, and as preparatory to addressing the myriad aforementioned policy concerns of average Americans.    

We can plea for decades about housing, student loan debt, jobs, Wall Street reform, but until we cleanse our own governing process of heavy undue influence, we can be assured that NO ONE in D.C. will be listening.  

This primary purpose of creating a more open and responsive Federal Government should be placed at the absolute center of the SOP for three critically important reasons:

1)It is something that Democrats, Conservatives, Libertarians, Socialists, and most others can agree upon.  The movement will be killed (and ignored) if it is simply a list of demands from the left that plays like a broken record.  The SOP needs to clearly invite all political views for a fair competition of ideas, and needs to fight for the same in DC.   This ought to be an American Movement,  not a Noam Chomsky, or Ron Paul movement.  

2)It is a logical prerequisite to addressing ALL other concerns.   One must clear the wax out of government's ears before we expect it to be able to listen and respond.   

3)It is highly actionable.   An Amendment is already drafted, and floating behind the scenes of congress.   This is “shovel ready.”  If fighting the fight means marching out day in day out, across the country, collecting millions of signatures, one by one, pledging citizens to vote down members of Congress that fail to vote to send the  Amendment through Congress to the states, then THE FIGHT IS ON – starting immediately.  This is clear, actionable, and foundational to all other serious concerns.

Thanks,  Brian M.

p.s.

The death of this movement is that it will not represent the political will of only a sliver of the population, rather than the 99%, or it will produce nothing actionable.  Keeping the FOCUS on priority #1 solves both of these problems. . .

bm_inboston is right, and I have mentioned this need to everyone (inside/outside of OB activities) whenever the movement has come up in conversation. The need to remove monetary influence from politics is a) non-partisan, b) accessible to a majority of people with a relatively simple explanation of the problem, and c) isn't divisive to anyone that's capable of/willing to think logically. It is the only &quot;for&quot; that the movement should put out there, everything else should be considered a separate agenda that other new or existing groups can fight for once the system has been cleaned of bribery and corruption.

I'm not trying to tell anyone what to do, but I feel more strongly about this one belief than anything I've ever cared for in my life. Money in politics is the root of every evil you will fight against. Money in politics is the root of every evil you will fight against.

I also think this is important, because at the outset, this movement was supposed to come up with one demand we could all agree on and get behind.  Does this work?
We want the United States Government to adopt economic policy that is fair, just and sustainable.  Fair to ALL of it's people, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle or economic status; with policies that promote the common good.  Just in it's ability not only to foster and reward hard work, ingenuity and achievement, but also to deter and punish greed, fraud and corruption.  Finally,  sustainable into the future, because protecting the human, natural and man-made resources of this planet from exploitation and abuse is the only way to ensure our survival.

Flat taxes are notoriously regressive and hit the poorest, the hardest.

Consider two families, one making $20k/yr (Family A) and the other making $80k/yr (Family B). After paying for rent/mortgage, food, energy, and other essentials Family A has significantly less to spend than Family B.

As it stands, America took in about $860B in income taxes last year, from $7.6T in income. That's a flat tax rate of 11.35%. Instituting a revenue-neutral flat tax in America would increase income taxes on the bottom 92% of America and decrease them on the top 8%. I don't believe that's a wise move forward.

With a progressive income tax, Family A pays less in taxes because they're a recognition that they can't afford to pay more. Family B is expected to pay more because they can afford to do so.

America's current income tax is progressive, but also saddled with multiple deductions and oddities. However, it ultimately still attempts to rate taxation based on relative disposal income rather than gross income.

The idea of a national guaranteed income with a national sales tax on consumption was proposed with the FairTax ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax ), which would ensure that every American family was given money equal to poverty level, but even so the estimates are that the sales tax would have to be 40% just to break even.

It's not a question of writing tax code, but generalities are still important: how progressive should it be? Revenue targets determine government expenditures, so how large is government? Abrogating responsibility and saying, &quot;you guys figure it out&quot; is not a good starting place, especially if someone (say, myself) proposes post-WW2-era marginal rates (top rate @ 80%) and then doesn't show how that effects everyone else.

The IRS posts data all over the place on tax collection; setting new margins and marginal rates isn't that difficult. Crunching the numbers is actually the easy part. The difficult part is trying to figure out how far to take things.

I like the idea of a tax off of gross person revenues. The reason I say this is that I'm intimately aware (Masters in Finance, small business owner) of how easy it is to &quot;game the system&quot; by deducting everything.  While some people (myself) focus on trying to pay our fair share. Others spend a great deal of time/energy figuring out ways to deduct everything.

My version of a &quot;fair&quot; tax would be one where the marginal value of the last dollar paid by each person was the same.  If you make $1 million, the next dollar isn't worth as much as if you make $100,000, which isn't worth as much as if you make $15,000.  Since the marginal value of a dollar isn't a linear function (research suggests that it drops off dramatically around $72,000 at the moment), the fairest system will tax income above that level at a higher rate than income below that level.

Additionally, thanks to the huge and gross income disparity you can not fund the government off a flat tax: you could take every penny the bottom 50% of this nation has and still not make as much money as a 17% tax levied on income over $100,000.  They simply don't have any money to take.

No. I believe strategically that the way to garner more support is to leave it even more open ended; let them come to us.  There will be chances down the road to offer more ideas. My favorite is electronic direct democracy on whatever they propose/crowd sourcing provisions.

==Color Codes?==
:[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 10, 2011 11:26 pm
I have been considering the effect of color coding for specific aspects of the wiki, particularly with tasks.

I have begun marking suggestions for things that /should/ be done in grey text. I considered using red, but thought it too bold. Maybe maroon instead?

I have already denoted the use of red/grey and green/blue for use in the 'suggestion box' &lt;https://occupyboston.wikispaces.com/Suggestion+Box&gt;

How does everyone feel about implementing a wiki-wide (or at least 'task'-wide) color scheme?

I don't think that extra effort will happen.  It's challenging enough to just get info posted in a logical location.  Much as I like colors and prganizing, I don't think it's realistic here.  Besides, it discriminates against the color blind.

==So here are the questions==
:[[user:jmagly]] Oct 15, 2011 6:59 pm
What does the tech team need there on the ground. 

IT
It sounds like the Media tent has a mesh server running though I am hearing that the live stream is inconsistent from users. 

Does the media team need additional help maintaining more persistent or higher throughput connections?

Secondly, general internet access in the camp could be improved I am sure. would it be worth while to explore methods of bringing connectivity to the area in general?

Power
I know there are bike generators available. All I have heard is they are being used to charge devices. What other power needs does the camp have?

Does anyone know the rules with what can be brought into the park with regard to power. I know gas generators and propane lamps are out. 

Environmental
What if anything should we be concerned about in this area?

Logistical Management
What is the camp doing for tracking information that is shared and for keeping inventory? What can be improved to make things go quicker/be easier?

Marketing
Obviously media is already working on quite a few things. Is there anything that media might like to see assuming we figure things out like power? 

Communication
What is in place for communication. Are there hand radios? Do we have methods for getting data out of the area should wireless and/or local area internet is cut off for extended periods of time?


Thats all I can think of at the moment.

==Issues discussion==
:[[user:qandnotq]] Wednesday, 3:23 pm
I am proposing that we can organize all of our demands into the framework of Commons, Affordability, and Accountability.

Protecting the Commons includes government access, environmental preservation and improvements, infrastructure and internets, the Marketplace, and so on...

Affordability is the demand that Government Access (Courts), Loans (Education and Mortgages...), and Health Services and Cost of Living must stay Affordable if our country is to thrive. (This doesn't mean it has to be easy. Just possible, which it currently isn't for many people.)

Accountability is straighforward, but demands transparency and action on profiteering in economic times like these. It is broadly anti-corruption as well. I like the term Accountability better than Transparency since it's more about action than access.

Feel free to debate this, or to start aligning our interests under these banners.

I am trying to understand where this Three Tier Vision is being proposed to fit in the Occupy movement.  If it's as an overarching &quot;vision&quot; for the movement, then I must disagree with it. I do not think that all or even most issues can fit into this framework, and I don't think that it's generally helpful to use this framework for all aspects of a vision, or to present it in this way. To me, this vision is formalistic in the way of 18th century political philosophers, who i think were limited in their scope to the questions that came to mind to mainly privileged members of society, in general ... Hobbes, Locke, those sort of people .. even the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the U.S.  .... limited in scope by the structure, and i don't see the point in starting from such a place here, where we have the advantage of a wider consciousness and wider participation. For example, where does freedom from gender-based oppression fit in? Where does a vision of a city with lots of bicycle paths fit in? Where does anti-racism fit in? Vision is not just protecting those things that we will call the commons, but also building up new things of beauty and inclusiveness.
====re: Issues discussion====
::[[user:reyraton]] Yesterday 6:55 am
Do you really think that demanding more bike paths is going to excite America? Or do you think couching that in terms of infrastructure investment under development of the Commons is a better idea? Because that isn't going to matter to someone in rural America as much as, say, bridges.

America is seriously in need of Big Ideas, and the more one drills down the easier it is to pick things apart. Formlessness is a virtue here. Specificity can come later. America remains a factional society and nation and if we can't keep things to a commonly-agreed consensus as to how things are awful and how they need fixing, we're going to marginalize ourselves.
====re: Issues discussion====
::[[user:Sage.Rad]] Yesterday 9:51 am
Yes, i think that a new vision for cities where bike riding is easier will excite some people. Other things will excite other people. There are millions of people with different minds. &quot;America&quot; -- who is that? Are we going to do some market research style thing?  I guess we can.  Anyway, it was one example i pulled out of my hat to illustrate something. I don't see &quot;Commons&quot; as a natural category for this exercise, nor the other two categories.  I don't really see the need for finding categories for everything.  I see a need for more democracy, a better process, for deciding what we all want to do. This addresses the negative we want to dismantle --  inequality, corruption, etc -- and the positive we want to build -- bridges, farmers markets, etc .. 

I don't see the need for a &quot;Big Idea&quot; -- shall we propose going to Mars by 2020?  Or are you saying that a &quot;Big Idea&quot; can be so vague as to mean nothing really?  Then my &quot;big idea&quot; is that I want bad things to be better. I'm not trying to be a semantics person. I guess you're looking to organize idea into categories. I'm looking for one main &quot;big idea&quot; which is the process, not the result -- more real democracy.
====re: Issues discussion====
::[[user:reyraton]] Yesterday 10:34 am
Until ideas are organized, they aren't really worth much for action. In my opinion, releasing a laundry list of demands is a sure-fire trip down the trash chute: &quot;oh, the hippies are asking for bike paths&quot;.

Spelling out that the American Society of Civil Engineers puts American infrastructure shortfall at $6.6T and suffering from chronic underinvestment (ie., $6.6T to bring America's roads, bridges, sewers and other infrastructure up to snuff) is a sign of government's abrogation of responsibility to the Commons, to maintain the underlying, literally physical structures of America.

City bike paths are installed as part of municipal actions based on budgetary calls, with input from state governments where additional money is needed. The federal government provides money to states for infrastructure development, but doesn't generally allocate money to individual projects unless they've been earmarked as such. In any case, &quot;bike paths&quot; as a budget line item would have to be part of a larger infrastructure spending bill... something that would address the tremendously neglected infrastructure component of the Commons.

That's the Big Idea.

Demanding bike paths is akin to demanding more water fountains in parks: it's not what the federal government does, not directly. Not only that, but if the feds don't give more money for development projects, then asking for bike paths essentially means asking for money to be re-apportioned from somewhere else in the city's budget. It's a request that doesn't address the larger concern, which is that the government's responsibility for development and infrastructure have been neglected for too long.
====re: Issues discussion====
::[[user:eli_gottlieb]] Yesterday 1:03 pm
I think Sage has a decent point about the fact that our framework currently doesn't have a place to fit matters of civil rights and liberties.

Where goeth the Patriot Act?  Where goeth anti-racism and anti-sexism?  Those things do deserve their place.  The tough bit is that once you create a category called &quot;Human Rights&quot; or &quot;Individual Rights&quot; or &quot;Civil Rights&quot;, or, frankly, anything with the words &quot;rights&quot; or &quot;liberties&quot; in the title, that tends to turn into a catch-all category.  People just start writing down whatever it is they want in life as a &quot;right&quot;.

This isn't to say that freedom from discrimination isn't important, but there are plenty of capitalist folks who will come down here and tell us that they have a right to unlimited accumulation of capital, a right to move their wealth into a tax haven, a right to limited liability through incorporating themselves, and a right to give unlimited campaign contributions.  Anything you want can be declared a &quot;right&quot; if you rationalize it adequately.

So could we maybe come up with a catchy way of saying &quot;Anti-Discrimination&quot;, and add another pillar for that?  It is a very real problem, and it addresses the whole range of identity-politic issues that otherwise don't fit into the existing framework.

I want to make sure that we eliminate the ability for corporations and the state to allow a development/construction project that threatens the health of a town's eco-system. This may include reversing references in case law suggesting that corporate personhood gives corporation the same rights as human beings.  It may mean changing the constitution so that corporations do not have more rights than people.  I might even go so far as to make it illegal for any corporate rules to force employees to chase profits over people.

The Commons is literally everything we share to keep our economies ecosystems, and social systems flourishing!

I believe that as an organizing frame it is unifying. 

Rallies, demonstrations, and festivals all utilize Commons.
Commuting and travelling all utilize the Commons.
Energy production is an enterprise of the Commons. 
The internet is the frontier of economic growth (and job creation), and it must be protected-- net neutrality.
Transportation systems. 
Clean air. 
Clean running water.
Political access is part of the Commons.
====re: THE COMMONS====
::[[user:eli_gottlieb]] Wednesday, 6:36 pm
As noted on the mailing list, a municipality is certainly an excellent example of a commons.

Zoning, however, is a thorny issue.  Terra, I know that you've seen an endless number of cases in which a Municipality-as-Commons would have had an obligation to protect townspeople by prohibiting a construction project that would have harmed the local ecosystem.  What makes it thorny is that there are also many instances in which municipalities have faced citizen outcry for allowing developments that would have made living in a certain town/city doable for minorities and the lower-paid (my fiance's town of Milton, MA has a gap in property values between the all-white side of town and the mixed-race side of town... guess how that price curve runs?).

On the upside, strong and clear commons laws specifying the fiduciary responsibilities of an ecosystem trustee would provide grounds for possible discrimination suits: if a town official blocks something and can't actually demonstrate the real harm to the ecosystem, a court could rule that they've simply engaged in disguised discrimination... right?

And on the other hand, plenty of towns and cities already have discrimination issues up the wazoo, so I guess that a change that helps the ecosystem without fixing discrimination is a positive step, even if it doesn't do nearly as much as we would like :-(.
====re: THE COMMONS====
::[[user:terrawiki]] Wednesday, 7:57 pm
Relative to Eli's zoning comments, yes, I agree that overriding &quot;some&quot; local zoning for affordable housing is warranted.  But I think that the important part of agreeing now, in this forum, is whether we agree that &quot;some&quot; affordable housing is necessary for &quot;some&quot; people.  Or whether &quot;any&quot; housing is necessary for &quot;all&quot; people. For example, suppose we said that &quot;basic shelter&quot; could be a tent in a park.  If that was acceptable, that would be fairly easy, fiscally. But if we said that everyone had to have two bedrooms and an office per person, and marble counter tops, then that starts getting unsustainable. Further, if we decided that &quot;some&quot; people would get the two-three bedroom townhouses and others got tents, then that doesn't seem fair either. So I feel like we need to agree on what &quot;basic&quot; housing is. And then make sure that everyone has access to that. THEN move into the well, if you have a little more money, then what.  But for this forum, I'd like to agree that &quot;basic shelter&quot; is a right. And later, we can decide what basic means. And then move on to deciding what mechanisms and steps we support to get there.

Relative to the internet, how do we feel about a &quot;carrier&quot; and their rights to own their &quot;outside plant&quot; cables?  I've often wondered about that, having a background in telecom.  We &quot;sold&quot; our airwaves to the highest bidder, instead of renting it to them. I find that fascinating.  I would have rather rented it, so we could have taken it back if we didn't like what the carrier did.
====re: THE COMMONS====
::[[user:eli_gottlieb]] Wednesday, 8:09 pm
I would rather have rented the airwaves, not only for the public control over them but to enforce things like net neutrality... and also to simply make telecom companies pay for their making private profit off of a public resource.

Ditto on the cables.  Frankly, most of the wired carriers actually took public subsidies at some point.  If anything is public property subject to public supervision, it's free government cash.

I believe this section captures a growing frustration and concern about our economy. 

CEOs and upper-level management of institutions and corporations are getting bonuses and raises as the working people are asked to take furloughs, pay cuts, and pension reductions. Unions are being busted to prevent any struggle by the workers. A business can be run into the ground, and the execs can take the lion's share while the workers have to fight to get paid for work done.

Debt is out of hand, and part of the problem is that rampant speculation and misleading marketing surrounding basics such as home ownership, education, and health insurance.

Farm subsidies, as an example, perpetuate a system that puts local farmers in debt for the work of big corporations.

Copyright and patent law protects big corporations at the expense of inventors and entrepreneurs who cannot afford to defend their fair use and fair competition. It inhibits the growth of clean energy, and it scares away talent from taking healthy risks.
====re: AFFORDABILITY / FISCAL &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY====
::[[user:eli_gottlieb]] Wednesday, 6:26 pm
The flagrant underpayment of taxes has also left public services and public goods run into the ground and decimated the living in once-honored professions.

Principals and administrators take home six-figure salaries while teachers spend their evaporating take-home pay to buy the kids pencils.

Young doctors are so burdened with debt that they literally cannot afford to work as general practitioners, even as our country faces a growing shortage thereof.

In real, inflation-adjusted dollars, funding for scientific research hasn't risen in years, even decades.  University chancellors and football coaches take home millions while grad students are stuck eating ramen noodles.

Monsanto and its captured regulatory agencies have done their study best to drive independent farming to extinction through abusive monopolies, abusive monopsonies, and frivolous lawsuits.

Utility companies have done their best to suppress job-creating innovations in telecommunications and energy while pocketing as much money from their natural and municipal monopolies as they can.

A story I've heard from Reddit recently: http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lf2nn/heres_the_thing_all_you_people_with_two_jobs_and/c2s6a2r

I'm older than you by a bit, I'm 36.

When I was 18 I was earning 40k a year as a carpenter. I had good health benefits. I had savings. I did not have student loans yet, but if I had I could have paid them easily. I worked hard for that money but working hard has never been the issue for most of us.. it's finding decent work that can pay the bills.

Even at that time, 20 years ago or so, I did not have it as good as my father did 20 years earlier. There was a time in this country where one working class man willing to get up in the morning and put in a solid days work could support a family in a comfortable manner.. without sacrificing health insurance or skipping meals.. without having to work 7 days a week and cut corners.

I fear many of you younger guys don't realize that. It was not always like this. That it's all you know doesn't make it right and it doesn't mean it has to be this way.

It's not &quot;work hard and sacrifice and you'll be able to barely get by.&quot; That's not the way it's supposed to be. Don't settle for that.

As requested on the mailing list, a side-note about affordable housing and gentrification:

I don't think we'll ever get a broad swathe of the American public to agree that housing, or food, or any other good someone has to actually supply, is a &quot;right&quot;.  That is, I don't think we'll get people to agree that someone should give me housing for free if I can't get my own housing.

What I do think we could get people to agree to is an &quot;Affordability Basket&quot;: a set of goods and services deemed so basic that we run economic policy around keeping their prices at a set level of affordability.  For example: if we deem the &quot;living wage poverty-line&quot; to be half the median yearly income (roughly $25,000/year for a household, or about $15,000/year for a single individual over the whole country, if Wikipedia is right), the twenty-fifth percentile, then we could say that at least 25% of rents must be at or lower than $521/month for a household or $312/month for an individual (AFAIK, 25% of monthly income spent on rent is deemed Good Household Budgeting).  These numbers could only rise if the median income rose.

I know that's a bit more geekish and complicated an approach than talking about Human Rights (which really do sound nice as lofty moral ideals), but the idea is that while most people wouldn't agree you have an abstract &quot;right&quot; for the municipality to just *give* you a housing unit, they would agree that society has an obligation to supply safe, habitable housing units at a price even the poor (which won't just be the long-term poor but the short-term unemployed or students, too) could afford.

Speaking of students, I think one immediate, low-level reform to pass is to have the Cities of Boston and Cambridge require the universities to build new housing units from their own damn budget whenever they raise their enrollment quotas.  They've been passing on their housing costs as an externality to the Boston-Cambridge rental market as an externality for too damn long!

I'm actually seriously into that idea about the universities.  I like universities; I like students.  I was one just a short while ago; I hope to be a grad-student some day in the future, and I hope to see my little brother go to university and do well sometime soon.  I just don't like the idea of universities adding tens of thousands of people to the local population and dumping them on the rental market as an externality.

So there's a VERY simple idea for a housing reform in Boston and Cambridge: fine every college/university $12,000/year for each student they enroll but cannot house on-campus.  $1000/month/person should be enough money to support the new dormitory, dining-hall and low-end apartment construction the universities won't do... or enough of a penalty to make them either do the construction themselves or decrease enrollment (which, given the way they treat student enrollment as a source of financial revenue rather than academic prestige these days, wouldn't be entirely a bad thing).

End corporate personhood.
Establish consumer protections.
Penalize profiteering, especially in a recession.
Make campaign financing transparent.
Prosecute private militia's abuses of foreign citizens in our name.

I think we can shorten that last one to &quot;prosecute private militias&quot;.  The whole point of government is to have a MONOPOLY ON LEGALIZED FORCE.  We need laws to ensure that NOBODY other than the government can employ military force on our soil or in our name.

A friend who works in DC suggested that the Senior Executive Service needs some work.  Also, better whistle-blower protection. 

I can't comment on the monopoly of power, because I haven't thought about it much.  But it seems worth talking about.

We've got the wiki link sent out to Transparency, Facilitators, and Media, alongside the old SPP/Visions mailing list.  I want to get it to the Anti-Oppression Folks, just to make sure it's general enough for them.

I'm focusing on getting a few people from the public.  Can you everyone get one person involved?

==I would like to see better==
:[[user:jmagly]] Oct 15, 2011 8:25 pm
I think having a good internet presence is key to communicating intent to the public. We will not be given media exposure. 

Being able to provide better engagement online will help bring people out to see whats going on as well as engage more people at home to support the call.

==Reference for Buffett Quote?==
:[[user:pcovery]] Yesterday 3:46 am
Is there a link to that Warrwn Buffett quote?  I assumed it was a hoax when I saw it.  If it's not real, it should be labeled differently.

You need to show where the quote ends on the page by closing the quote marks, and make it more clear that the entire page is not a Buffett quote.

Fixed it for you.  There is now an end-quote mark on your page.  I don't know where the Buffett quote actually ended in your text, so I was conservative about it.

==Tags Discussion==
:[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 15, 2011 9:29 am
There has been a request to open 'tags' to the general wiki community.

&quot;The clouds thing is generally used to show the relative prevalence of ideas that show up on the wiki. Creating a tag is truly the job of the contributor not 'IT'. In evolving parts of the wiki contributors tags could be a valuable way to work toward a consensus of ideas. It fits better with the opensource philosophy [...] that you see in the GA's.&quot;

Tags are not in any way closed to general editing. The issue being presented is instead my moderation of tags - as I have done so without regard for how others may feel about tags. Let me explain my position, and then we shall discuss and seek consensus.

As the wiki stands now, there are 97 pages and 7 tags that I have been monitoring. Here are the main reasons that I intend to continue monitoring tags:

1. Tags are often added as redundant place-holders.
2. Tags are often added even when their relevancy is very small.

These patterns lead to massive tag lists with many tags being used only once. I consider this 'clutter.' 

I always consider the effectiveness and future use of a tag before deletion. In the case of redundancy, I delete the tag. If it is the only instance of the tag and its base is not quite wide enough to encompass many future pages, I delete the tag. If it is vague, I delete the tag.

All cases of deletion are easily remedied: no one is prevented from changing tags; the only issue is their moderation.

If you agree with monitoring tags, please make suggestions and/or go about monitoring tags on your own. If you disagree with monitoring tags, this is the place to voice your disagreement - otherwise I probably will continue to delete tags based upon the considerations I have highlighted above.

Thank you; please discuss
====re: idea Tag cloud - software doesn&#039;t allow it====
::[[user:mcktimo]] Oct 15, 2011 10:05 am
Originally tags weren't locked, however they are now because this particular wiki software uses tags in order to create and sort the navigation menu on the left. 

As a result, we have to lock the tagging ability in order to preserve the navigation. If we open it up and everyone adds and removes tags the navigation goes completely haywire and it becomes very difficult for users to find what they need in the wiki.

I think using tags to get consensus would be an awesome idea, but unfortunately we are limited by the current software we are using.
====re: Tags Discussion====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 15, 2011 10:48 pm
i believe you may be missing something, mcktimo.

i believe anyone can add tags (just click the drop-down next to 'Page' at the top of any link, and click 'view details and tags'. (if non-admin members prove this to be untrue, please send me a personal message!)

only admins may edit the navigation bar, which i have locked. as far as i know i am the only direct contributor to that page, as the other admins assume that i keep focus.

the navigation bar is under manual control (it no longer relies on tags) but i still use tags to monitor certain sets of pages. this function is part of the 'manage wiki' section.

software is not limiting us in the use of tags.
====re: Tags Discussion====
::[[user:OneKarma]] Oct 17, 2011 12:41 am
i think found the answer i was looking for. by redefining non-structural tags as keywords, we avoid the issue. please refer to edited version of wiki guidelines, in the tag section, of course!

==Donated clothing list- wants/ideas==
:[[user:cmax1088]] Today 9:47 am
There are a lot of things that would be helpful and brainstorming and asking for them may spur people to donate things they didn't think were useful or didn't think of themselves.


Scarves, hats, gloves.

All types of material, not just poly pro is useful. Wool!!! Fleece, down.

Gortex/nylon. 

Also, not sure how people would respond but fur lined clothing is obviously very warm.
