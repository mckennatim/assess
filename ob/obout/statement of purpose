===[[SOP Inspiration]]=== 
: This is where we can put other statements (i.e. OWS, Declaration of Independence) as well as editorials, pieces of theory, etc. that we might find useful to think with. Sometimes it's good to rub our ideas against other people's ideas--then sparks fly in interesting ways.<br>
: The [[education]] page of the wiki has a wealth of interesting articles and sources.
